Prospective Students can contact me at: ![](/img/mail.png) Students are expected to be able to work independently, collaborate with others cohesively, think critically about their own projects and be willing to learn new tools for their research, such as GRASS, QGIS, Python, R, Matplotlib, Numpy, etc. I welcome students who are not afraid of computers and math. Please read through this site (projects, publications, etc) to get a better idea of my research scope prior to inquiries. 

### Supervision

I am currently associated with two Graduate Programs at the University of São Paulo:   

**Mineral Resources and Hydrogeology** ([RMH - Recursos Minerais e Hidrogeologia](http://sites.igc.usp.br/posgraduacao/rmh/)).  
This program is characterised by Applied Geosciences studies. My line of work focus on Geotechnologies.  

**Environmental Sciences** ([PROCAM - Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ciências Ambientais](http://www.iee.usp.br/pos/?q=procam)).  
This program has a strong socio-environmental focus, leaning towards the Humanities and multidisciplinarity.  

**Note:** Prospective students are advised to read the program's pages (links above) and be aware that internal norms/regulations and deadlines for subscriptions are different for these two programs. I will try to keep and updated scheduled of deadlines in the right sidebar, but I can't promise anything. Check constantly the program's pages for official, updated information. Also, it is wise to think ahead. Sending me an email with a project proposal only one month before the subscription deadline is not the best way to start. We need at least 3-4 months to work on a good proposal.
