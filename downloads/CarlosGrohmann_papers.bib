  abstract  = {This work presents the development of a three-dimensional (3D) model of an outcrop of the Corumbataí Formation (Permian, Paraná Basin, Brazil) using Structure from Motion - Multi-View Stereo (SfM-MVS) technique in order to provide a structural analysis of clastic dikes cutting through siltstone layers. While traditional photogrammetry requires the user to input a series of parameters related to the camera orientation and its characteristics (such as focal distance), in SfM-MVS the scene geometry, camera position and orientations are automatically determined by a bundle adjustment, an iterative procedure based on a set of overlapping images. It is considered a low-cost technique in terms of hardware and software, also being able to provide point density and accuracy on par to the ones obtained withTerrestrial Laser Scanning. The results acquired on this research have good agreement with previous works, yielding a NNW main orientation for the dikes measured in the field and on the 3D model. The development of this work showed that SfM-MVS use and practice on geosciences still needs more studies on the optimization of the involved parameters (such as camera orientation, image overlap and angle of illumination), which, when accomplished, will result in less processing time and more accurate models.},

  abstract  = {The shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM), was flow on the space shuttle Endeavour in February 2000, with the objective of acquiring a digital elevation model of all land between 60° north latitude and 56° south latitude, using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques. The SRTM data are distributed at horizontal resolution of 1 arc‐second (∼30 m) for areas within the USA and at 3 arc‐second (∼90 m) resolution for the rest of the world. A resolution of 90 m can be considered suitable for the small or medium‐scale analysis, but it is too coarse for more detailed purposes. One alternative is to interpolate the SRTM data at a finer resolution; it will not increase the level of detail of the original digital elevation model (DEM), but it will lead to a surface where there is the coherence of angular properties (i.e. slope, aspect) between neighbouring pixels, which is an important characteristic when dealing with terrain analysis. This work intents to show how the proper adjustment of variogram and kriging parameters, namely the nugget effect and the maximum distance within which values are used in interpolation, can be set to achieve quality results on resampling SRTM data from 3” to 1”. We present for a test area in western USA, which includes different adjustment schemes (changes in nugget effect value and in the interpolation radius) and comparisons with the original 1” model of the area, with the national elevation dataset (NED) DEMs, and with other interpolation methods (splines and inverse distance weighted (IDW)). The basic concepts for using kriging to resample terrain data are: (i) working only with the immediate neighbourhood of the predicted point, due to the high spatial correlation of the topographic surface and omnidirectional behaviour of variogram in short distances; (ii) adding a very small random variation to the coordinates of the points prior to interpolation, to avoid punctual artifacts generated by predicted points with the same location than original data points and; (iii) using a small value of nugget effect, to avoid smoothing that can obliterate terrain features. Drainages derived from the surfaces interpolated by kriging and by splines have a good agreement with streams derived from the 1” NED, with correct identification of watersheds, even though a few differences occur in the positions of some rivers in flat areas. Although the 1” surfaces resampled by kriging and splines are very similar, we consider the results produced by kriging as superior, since the spline‐interpolated surface still presented some noise and linear artifacts, which were removed by kriging.},

  abstract  = {Development and interpretation of morphometric maps are important tools in studies related to neotectonics and geomorphology; Geographic Information Systems (GIS) allows speed and precision to this process, but applied methodology will vary according to available tools and degree of knowledge of each researcher about involved software.
A methodology to integrate GIS and statistics in morphometric analysis is presented for the most usual morphometric parameters - hypsometry, slope, aspect, swath profiles, lineaments and drainage density, surface roughness, isobase and hydraulic gradient.
The GIS used was the Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS-GIS), an open- source project that offers an integrated environment for raster and vector analysis, image processing and maps/graphics creation. Statistical analysis of parameters can be carried out on R, a system for statistical computation and graphics, through an interface with GRASS that allows raster maps and points files to be treated as variables for analysis.
The basic element for deriving morphometric maps is the digital elevation model (DEM). It can be interpolated from scattered points or contours, either in raster or vector format; it is also possible to use DEMs from NASAs Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission, with 30m of ground resolution for the USA and 90m for other countries.
Proposed methodology can be adapted according to necessities and available tools. The use of free and open-source tools guarantees access to everyone, and its increasing popularization opens new development perspectives in this research field.},

Morphometric maps were evaluated in GRASS-GIS and statistics were made on R statistical language, using the spatial package. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was made to test the significance of each surface and the significance of increasing polynomial

DEM-derived drainage presented satisfactory results when compared to a 1:50,000 topographic map. SRTM 03″ proved to be a good resource for geomorphological analysis, up to the semi-detail scale.},

  abstract  = {A Nappe system south to southwest of the São Francisco Craton represents the southern extension of the Brası́lia belt and describes an inverted metamorphic pile of greenschist facies toward amphibolite facies. The Aiuruoca-Andrelândia nappe is one of the nappes of this system. The hind portion of the Aiuruoca-Andrelândia nappe, south of Caxambu and Aiuruoca (MG), consists of a structural-metamorphic domain transported toward the E-NE. There is a metamorphic transition, from the kyanite zone to kyanite and sillimanite coexistence, until the sillimanite zone. Metapelitic rocks preserve high-pressure parageneses (Rt–Ky–Grt–Ms–Bt–Pl–Qtz) and contain retrograde eclogitic rocks. Sil–Pl–Qtz coronitic intergrowths around garnets are common decompressive textures. Kyanite schists register the Pmax of 11 kbar at 660 °C and define a decompressive path until 6–7.5 kbar at 650 °C. These P–T conditions represent the equilibrium in S2 schistosity (amphibolite facies) and the beginning of the cooling path in the Ky–Sil transition. The decompressive path suggests an extrusional process, immediately after burying at about 60 km. Exhumation controlled by convergent events, related to the São Francisco Plate subduction and tectonic erosion, took these units, isothermally, to higher levels (20–33 km). Later, the metamorphic path shifted toward near-isobaric cooling.},

  abstract  = {The Xingu River is a large clearwater river in eastern Amazonia and its downstream sector, known as the Volta Grande do Xingu ("Xingu Great Bend"), is a unique fluvial landscape that plays an important role in the biodiversity, biogeochemistry and prehistoric and historic peopling of Amazonia. The sedimentary dynamics of the Xingu River in the Volta Grande and its downstream sector will be shifted in the next few years due to the construction of dams associated with the Belo Monte hydropower project. Impacts on river biodiversity and carbon cycling are anticipated, especially due to likely changes in sedimentation and riverbed characteristics. This research project aims to define the geological and climate factors responsible for the development of the Volta Grande landscape and to track its environmental changes during the Holocene, using the modern system as a reference. In this context, sediment cores, riverbed rock and sediment samples and greenhouse gas (GHG) samples were collected in the Volta Grande do Xingu and adjacent upstream and downstream sectors. The reconstruction of past conditions in the Volta Grande is necessary for forecasting future scenarios and defining biodiversity conservation strategies under the operation of Belo Monte dams. This paper describes the scientific questions of the project and the sampling surveys performed by an international team of Earth scientists and biologists during the dry seasons of 2013 and 2014. Preliminary results are presented and a future workshop is planned to integrate results, present data to the scientific community and discuss possibilities for deeper drilling in the Xingu ria to extend the sedimentary record of the Volta Grande do Xingu.},

The maps were produced using the methodology of map algebra developed in GIS environment, in which triggering factors and their respective weights were defined as the influence on the outbreak of the studied events. For the analysis of vulnerability to the occurrence of leaks in water supply network we used map algebra factors of age, network pressure and number of recurring maintenance. The highest vulnerability occurred in networks that had already suffered recurring maintenance, but as we launched to the map the geological accidents that were surveyed, these were associated with areas of high or medium vulnerabilities. Thus, it can be concluded that other factors analyzed (age and pressure) had greatest influence in the initiation of these events. Thereby it can be concluded that the methodology applied was satisfactory to the proposed objectives. It is important to mention that the methodology can be fully developed free programs in GIS, which facilitate the access to public agencies},

  abstract  = {The acquisition of geological attitudes on rock cuts using traditional field compass survey can be a time consuming, dangerous, or even impossible task depending on the conditions and location of outcrops. The importance of this type of data in rock-mass classifications and structural geology has led to the development of new techniques, in which the application of photogrammetric 3D digital models has had an increasing use. In this paper we present two algorithms for extraction of attitudes of geological discontinuities from virtual outcrop models: ply2atti and scanline, implemented with the Python programming language. The ply2atti algorithm allows for the virtual sampling of planar discontinuities appearing on the 3D model as individual exposed surfaces, while the scanline algorithm allows the sampling of discontinuities (surfaces and traces) along a virtual scanline. Application to digital models of a simplified test setup and a rock cut demonstrated a good correlation between the surveys undertaken using traditional field compass reading and virtual sampling on 3D digital models.},

  abstract  = {Source-to-sink systems are poorly known in tropical rivers. For the Amazonian rivers, the majority of the provenance studies remain focused on the suspended load, implying a poor understanding of the processes governing production and distribution of sands. In this study, we perform heavy mineral and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) analysis to cover the entire spectrum (heavy and light minerals fraction) of 29 sand samples of the Lower Madeira river region (Amazon and Madeira rivers), of which the main goal was to find provenance indicators specific to these rivers. Despite the tropical humid climate, the sands of the Amazon and Lower Madeira rivers are rich in unstable heavy minerals as augite, hypersthene, green hornblende and andalusite. The Madeira river is highlighted by its higher content of andalusite, with source attributed to the Amazon Craton (medium-to-high grade metamorphic rocks), while the Amazon river, upstream of the Madeira river mouth, has a signature of augite and hypersthene, that suggests an Andean provenance (volcanic rocks). Sands from the Madeira river can be tracked in the Amazon river by the increasing concentration in andalusite. OSL analysis of the light minerals fraction was used as an index of feldspar concentration and sedimentary history of quartz grains. Lower feldspar concentration and quartz grains with longer sedimentary history (higher OSL sensitivity) also point to a major contribution of cratonic sources for the sands in the Madeira river. While the sands from the Lower Madeira would be mainly supplied by cratonic rocks, previous work recognised that suspended sediments (silt and clay) are derived from Andean rocks. Therefore, we interpret a decoupling between the sources of sand and mud (silt and clay) under transport in the Madeira river. Andean sands (rich in augite and hypersthene) would be trapped in the foreland zones of the Beni and Mamoré tributaries. In the Amazon river sands, the low OSL sensitivity of the quartz, higher content of feldspar and unstable heavy mineral assemblage dominated by augite and hypersthene suggest both a fast transport from Andean sources with fine sediment bypass over foreland areas.},

Using a low resolution DEM for regional scale morphometric analysis is not an optimal choice, since attenuation of elevation will strongly affect the distribution of calculated parameters. Unless bounded by computational constraints, one should choose to derive basic morphometric parameters from higher resolution data, and resample it to a coarser resolution as needed.},

Analysis included generation of maps of isobase, hydraulic gradients, hypsometry, incision of drainage basins, drainage asymmetry and anomalous morphological features. All these maps generated results that agreed with field data and helped define recent faults in directions close to N–S and E–W, both probably reactivated faults of the Paraná Basin and the basement. Geomorphological features identified in topographic maps, possibly related to neotectonism, have a close agreement with our observations in the field. The asymmetry of basins as analysed by the T-Index method proved to be compatible with the influence of a E–W compressive tectonic regime and showed a movement from W to E. Application of the hypsometric integral technique helped establish a correlation between the younger basins with structures trending N–S (± 30°). The N–S faults were related to a compressional stress field (SHmax) close to E–W and SHmin (stress minimum) around N–S, thereby establishing a tectonic context of structures developed in a transpressive regime. The compressional field was caused by the subduction of the Nazca tectonic plate below the South American plate, whereas the transcurrent component exploited pre-existent E–W structures when the Atlantic Ocean was opening.},

The bivalves are associated with ichnofossils and were collected from a bed in the upper part of the formation, within a 25 cm thick interval of dark siltstones and mudstones with planar lamination, overlain by massive sandstones. The shells are articulated, with the valves either splayed open or closed. At the top of the succession, mudstone beds nearly 1.5 m above the bivalve-bearing layers yielded well-preserved Glossopteris sp. cf. G. communis leaf fossils. The closed articulated condition of some shells indicates preservation under high sedimentation rates with low residence time of bioclasts at the sediment/water interface. However, the presence of specimens with splayed shells is usually correlated to the slow decay of the shell ligament in oxygen-deficient bottom waters. The presence of complete carbonized leaves of Glossopteris associated with the bivalve-bearing levels also suggests a possibly dysoxic-anoxic bottom environment. Overall, our data suggest that the bivalves were preserved by abrupt burial, possibly by distal sediment flows into a Brenton Loch lake, and may represent autochthonous to parautochthonous fossil accumulations. The shells resemble those of anthracosiids and are herein assigned to Palaeanodonta sp. aff. P. dubia, a species also found in the Permian succession of the Karoo Basin, South Africa. Our results confirm that (a) the true distributions in space and time of all Permian non-marine (freshwater) bivalves are not yet well known, and (b) there is no evidence for marine conditions in the upper part of the Brenton Loch Formation.},

  abstract    = {In this work, we analyze how variation in cell size influences the volume calculated from digital terrain models (DTMs) derived from a LiDAR (light detection and ranging) survey in two coastal Late Holocene dune fields in southern Brazil. Cell size varied from 1 to 100m. RMSE (root mean square error) of the resampled DTMs from the original LiDAR (with 0.5m resolution) increases linearly with cell size, while R2 (coefficient of determination) decreases following a second-order trend. The volume does not show simple linear or exponential behavior, but fluctuates with positive and negative deviations from the original DTM. This can be explained by a random factor in the position of the cell with regard to landforms and a relationship between cell and landform size, wherein a small change in cell size can lead to an under- or overestimation of volume. The ASTER GDEM (global digital elevation model) and X-SAR SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) 1″ digital elevation models (DEMs) were not considered viable volume sources due to large deviations from the reference data, either as a consequence of noise in the SRTM X-SAR data or lack of bias elevation correction to a common reference base in the GDEM processing chain. Volumes from a 3-arcsec SIR-C SRTM deviated around ±5% from the reference data and are considered suitable input for numerical simulations of Quaternary dune field evolution models because these values should be within the expected range of sediment volume changes over hundreds to millions of years.},

The base-level map can be seen as a "simplified" version of the original topographic surface, from which the "noise" of the low-order stream erosion was removed. This method is able to identify areas with possible tectonic influence even within lithologically uniform domains. Base-level maps have been recently applied in semi-detail scale (e.g., 1:50 000 or larger) morphotectonic analysis. In this paper, we present an evaluation of the method's applicability in regional-scale analysis (e.g., 1:250 000 or smaller). A test area was selected in northern Brazil, at the lower course of the Araguaia and Tocantins rivers. The drainage network extracted from SRTM30_PLUS DEMs with spatial resolution of approximately 900 m was visually compared with available topographic maps and considered to be compatible with a 1:1,000 000 scale. Regarding the interpretation of regional-scale morphostructures, the map constructed with 2nd and 3rd-order valleys was considered to present the best results. Some of the interpreted base-level anomalies correspond to important shear zones and geological contacts present in the 1:5 000 000 Geological Map of South America. Others have no correspondence with mapped Precambrian structures and are considered to represent younger, probably neotectonic, features. A strong E-W orientation of the base-level lines over the inflexion of the Araguaia and Tocantins rivers, suggest a major drainage capture. A N-S topographic swath profile over the Tocantins and Araguaia rivers reveals a topographic pattern which, allied with seismic data showing a roughly N-S direction of extension in the area, lead us to interpret this lineament as an E-W, southward-dipping normal fault. There is also a good visual correspondence between the base-level lineaments and geophysical anomalies. A NW-SE lineament in the southeast of the study area partially corresponds to the northern border of the Mosquito lava field, of Jurassic age, and a NW-SE lineament traced in the northeastern sector of the study area can be interpreted as the Picos-Santa Inês lineament, identifiable in geophysical maps but with little expression in hypsometric or topographic maps.},

  abstract  = {The Neoproterozoic (Ediacaran) Itapucumí Group in northern Paraguay is composed of carbonate and siliciclastic rocks, including ooid grainstones, marls, shales and sandstones, containing Cloudina fossils in the eastern region. It is almost undeformed over the Rio Apa Cratonic Block but shows a strong deformational pattern at its western edge. A detailed structural analysis of the Itapucumí Group was conducted in the Vallemí Mine, along with a regional survey in other outcrops downstream in the Paraguay River and in the San Alfredo, Cerro Paiva and Sargento José E. López regions. In the main Vallemí quarry, the structural style is characterized by an axial-plane slaty cleavage in open to isoclinal folds, sometimes overturned, associated with N–S trending thrust faults and shear zones of E-vergence and with a low-grade chlorite zone metamorphism. The structural data presented here are compatible with the hypothesis of a newly recognized mobile belt on the western side of the Rio Apa Cratonic Block, with opposite vergence to that of the Paraguay Mobile Belt in Brazil. Both belts are related to the Late Brasiliano/Pan-African tectonic cycle with a Lower Cambrian deformation and metamorphism age. The deformation could be due to the late collision of the Amazonian Craton with the remainder of Western Gondwana or to the western active plate boundary related to the Pampean Belt. The structural and lithologic differences between the western Itapucumí Group in the Vallemí and Paraguay River region and the eastern region, near San Alfredo and Cerro Paiva, suggest that this group could be divided into two lithostratigraphic units, but more stratigraphic and geochronological analyses are required to confirm this possibility.},

  abstract    = {Surface roughness is an important geomorphological variable which has been used in the Earth and planetary sciences to infer material properties, current/past processes, and the time elapsed since formation. No single definition exists; however, within the context of geomorphometry, we use surface roughness as an expression of the variability of a topographic surface at a given scale, where the scale of analysis is determined by the size of the landforms or geomorphic features of interest. Six techniques for the calculation of surface roughness were selected for an assessment of the parameter's behavior at different spatial scales and data-set resolutions. Area ratio operated independently of scale, providing consistent results across spatial resolutions. Vector dispersion produced results with increasing roughness and homogenization of terrain at coarser resolutions and larger window sizes. Standard deviation of residual topography highlighted local features and did not detect regional relief. Standard deviation of elevation correctly identified breaks of slope and was good at detecting regional relief. Standard deviation of slope (SDslope) also correctly identified smooth sloping areas and breaks of slope, providing the best results for geomorphological analysis. Standard deviation of profile curvature identified the breaks of slope, although not as strongly as SDslope, and it is sensitive to noise and spurious data. In general, SDslope offered good performance at a variety of scales, while the simplicity of calculation is perhaps its single greatest benefit.},

Os resultados obtidos nas diferentes técnicas utilizadas apresentam elipsoides com geometria e parâmetros de forma semelhantes entre si, mas com grau de anisotropias diferentes. As orientações dos eixos dos elipsoides obtidos são condizentes com as estruturas geológicas observadas em campo, como a foliação principal e a lineação mineral. Entre as características observadas nos elipsoides de deformação obtidos nesse trabalho, destacam-se a forte orientação do eixo C (associado ao polo da foliação) e o predomínio de elipsoides associados a tramas planares e plano-lineares (predomínio de achatamento na deformação).

Visual analysis and elevation histograms point to a finer effective spatial (i.e., horizontal) resolution of TanDEM-X compared to SRTM and ASTER GDEM. In areas of open vegetation, TanDEM-X lower elevations indicate a deeper penetration of the radar signal. DEMs of differences (DoDs) allowed the identification of issues inherent to the production methods of the analyzed DEMs, such as mast oscillations in SRTM data and mismatch between adjacent scenes in ASTER GDEM and ALOS AW3D30. A systematic difference in elevations between TanDEM-X 12m, TanDEM-X 30m, and SRTM was observed in the steep slopes of the coastal ranges, related to the moving-window process used to resample the 12m data to a 30m pixel size. It is strongly recommended to produce a DoD with SRTM before using ASTER GDEM or ALOS AW3D30 in any analysis, to evaluate if the area of interest is affected by these problems. The DoDs also highlighted changes in land use in the time span between the acquisition of SRTM (2000) and TanDEM-X (2013) data, whether by natural causes or by human interference in the environment. The results show a high level of detail and consistency for TanDEM-X data, indicate that the effective horizontal resolution of SRTM is coarser than the nominal 30m, and highlight the errors in ASTER GDEM and ALOS AW3D30 due to mismatch between adjacent scenes in the photogrammetric process.},

  abstract  = {In the Amazonian lowlands, the shift from a large wetland dominated by flooded forests (Várzea) to the modern incised valleys bounded by extensive areas of non-flooded forests (Terra Firme) is considered a key driver of the Amazonian mega-biodiversity. Dating the sedimentary beds covered by Terra Firme forest is crucial to constrain the timing of such landscape change. Here we determined the formation ages of widespread regions of Terra Firme substrates in central Amazonian lowlands combining optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, magnetostratigraphy and palinostratigraphy. Our data suggest a very dynamic fluvial system leading to a recent expansion of Terra Firme forests and retraction of Várzea forests during the late Pleistocene. The shift from an extensively flooded to non-flooded surface resulted from river incision around 45-35 ka, which potentially influenced the distribution of taxa by expanding available habitat, creating new barriers to dispersal, or changing the permeability of previous barriers. Transitions between flooded and non-flooded landscapes may have driven diversification and caused changes to species distributions, contributing to the high species diversity and biogeographic patterns currently found in the region. The late Quaternary evolution of Terra Firme substrates reveals that physical landscape changes play a major role in shaping biotic habitats even in the 104–105 years time-scales.},

  abstract  = {The origin of modern disjunct plant distributions in the Brazilian Highlands with strong floristic affinities to distant montane rainforests of isolated mountaintops in the northeast and northern Amazonia and the Guyana Shield remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that these unexplained biogeographical patterns reflect former ecosystem rearrangements sustained by widespread plant migrations possibly due to climatic patterns that are very dissimilar from present-day conditions. To address this issue, we mapped the presence of the montane arboreal taxa Araucaria, Podocarpus, Drimys, Hedyosmum, Ilex, Myrsine, Symplocos, and Weinmannia, and cool-adapted plants in the families Myrtaceae, Ericaceae, and Arecaceae (palms) in 29 palynological records during Heinrich Stadial 1 Event, encompassing a latitudinal range of 30°S to 0°S. In addition, Principal Component Analysis and Species Distribution Modelling were used to represent past and modern habitat suitability for Podocarpus and Araucaria. The data reveals two long-distance patterns of plant migration connecting south/southeast to northeastern Brazil and Amazonia with a third short route extending from one of them. Their paleofloristic compositions suggest a climatic scenario of abundant rainfall and relative lower continental surface temperatures, possibly intensified by the effects of polar air incursions forming cold fronts into the Brazilian Highlands. Although these taxa are sensitive to changes in temperature, the combined pollen and speleothems proxy data indicate that this montane rainforest expansion during Heinrich Stadial 1 Event was triggered mainly by a less seasonal rainfall regime from the subtropics to the equatorial region.},

  abstract   = {This work presents a 1:10,000 geomorphological mapping of an area in southeastern Brazil, based on morphometric analysis of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), while classical methods focus on photo interpretation. Data derived from the DEM include elevation, slope gradient, slope aspect, vertical and horizontal curvatures, amplitude, elongation and wavelength of landforms. These parameters were used along with slope shape and drainage patterns to classify the landforms according to the Land Systems method, in which portions of the landscape that presents similar terrains attributes are grouped from regional (low detail) to local (high detail) scales, respectively, Land Systems, Land Units and Land Elements. The São Paulo State geomorphological map at 1:1,000,000 scale is considered the best reference source, and was compared with the results obtained in this project. Two Land Systems, four Land Units and twelve Land Elements were identified in the study area. In this area, karst terrains are common and easily identified due their characteristics drainage patterns, amplitude and slope gradient. Karst terrain boundaries defined in this study do overlap with those defined in the state map, however the morphometric analysis allowed a better description of the terrain attributes used to define them. The terrain attributes derived automatically from the DEM enabled an accurate geomorphological classification of the study area. The methodology presented in this paper is considered effective for mapping landforms at a detailed scale and can be employed in regional scale mapping using coarser resolution DEMs.},

This paper focuses on an analytical overview of approaches addressed by five different CCS atlases published by Brazil, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Norway, and South Africa. The five atlases are available for public access; an analytical overview could substantiate the academic and technical decisions related to the future publication of a new atlas for any country and suggests the inclusion of new topics such as social and environmental issues.},

We discuss the importance of comparing evolutionary taxonomic units across groups and considering their particular environmental affinities as a framework for a mechanistic understanding of how the diversity of Amazonia was assembled across space and time. Although lineage diversity of the Amazonian biota is often quite old, current evidence indicates that much of Amazonia’s observed “species-level” diversity, as exemplified by birds, mammals, and butterflies, is young, mostly dating to the Quaternary. Much of the modern Amazonian landscape, including in particular its hydrological and environmental systems, was shaped over the Pliocene and Quaternary (last 5 Ma), yet significant landscape change affecting the evolution of biotas is less than 2 million years old.},

  abstract  = {We present a new 52m composite record (COL17c) composed of five sedimentary sequences retrieved from the Colônia basin (Southeastern Brazil). The COL17c record is composed of two main sub-units deposited under different regimes: a peatland above ~14m and lacustrine sediments below. Sedimentary description and core scanning (MSCL and XRF) are first used to align individual cores in order to produce a nearly continuous composite record. We then established an original chronological framework based on radiocarbon, paleomagnetic, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), post-infrared infrared stimulated luminescence at elevated temperature (pIRIR290°C) and authigenic 10Be/9Be dating. We describe the protocols used for each technique and discuss the positive and negative results, as well as their implications for proxy interpretation. In spite of negative results of some techniques, mainly due to the absence of adequate sample material, the multi-proxy approach used is essential to maximize the chances of obtaining a satisfactory age model for this unique continental sedimentary sequence. All valid chronological proxies, comprising three AMS 14C ages, one pIRIR290°C age, two paleomagnetic constraints and eight authigenic 10Be/9Be datum, are integrated within a Bayesian age-depth modeling to produce a 1.5±0.1Ma chronology for the whole COL17c sequence. This age model represents the first long-term chronological estimate of sediments deposition in the Colônia basin. The record allows to refine the age of the Colônia basin formation between 5.3 and 11.2Ma, much older than previously estimated from short sedimentary cores.},

  abstract  = {Sand dunes are commonly regarded as a challenge to traditional photogrammetry due their homogeneous texture and spectral response. In this work we present an evaluation of Structure from Motion-Multi View Stereo (SfM-MVS) to obtain high-resolution elevation data of coastal sand dunes based on images acquired by Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA). A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of a dunefield in Southern Brazil was generated from 810 photos captured by an RPA at 100m above the takeoff point in February 2019. Image matching was successful in all areas of the survey due the presence of superficial features (footprints and sandboard tracks) and visibility of the sedimentary stratification, highlighted by heavy minerals. Altimetric accuracy of the SfM-MVS DEM was validated by comparison with Terrestrial LiDAR (TLS) data collected during the same fieldwork campaign of the RPA flights. The SfM-MVS DEM was then compared to an Airborne LiDAR (ALS) DEM from October 2010. While the SfM-MVS and TLS DEMs are very similar, without any major difference in elevation or in the reconstruction of topographic features, the SfM-MVS DEM presents a small scale surface roughness not visible in the TLS DEM. The Feature Preserving DEM Smoothing (FPD) algorithm was applied to the SfM-MVS DEM with good results in terms of surface smoothing, but without any significant changes in descriptive statistics and error metrics, with an RMSE of 0.08m and MAE of 0.06m for both the original and the FPD-filtered DEM. Displacement of dune crest lines from the ALS and SfM-MVS DEMs resulted in a migration rate of ≈5m/year between 2010 and 2019, in good agreement with rates derived from satellite images and historical aerial photographs of the same area. Sand volume change in the same period showed a decrease of only 0.2%, which can be related to the installation of sand fences to promote dune stabilization and sand removal from the front of the dune field to keep a road open to vehicles. ALS can cover large areas in little time but its high cost still remains a barrier to wider usage, especially by researchers in developing countries. TLS has an intermediate cost but demands more fieldwork and more processing time. In our case we needed three days for the TLS survey and around three weeks to produce a DEM of ≈80400m2. On the other hand, we were able to cover ≈740900m2 with six flight missions in under three hours, with ≈13h processing time in a medium-range workstation. This makes SfM-MVS a low-cost solution with fast and reliable results for 3D modelling and continuous monitoring of coastal dunes.},

The highest microplastics concentrations were observed in samples from shallow water (water depth of 5–7m) sites with lower water velocity of the Negro river surrounding Manaus, and the lowest concentration in farthest sample collected in deeper zone (water depth of 34m) of the Amazon river around 110km downstream Manaus. The variation of microplastics concentrations within the studied area can be related to hydraulic characteristics defining the erosive-depositional behavior of the sampling sites and their proximity to Manaus. Our results represent the first report to show the ubiquitous presence and widespread distribution of microplastics in sediments from the lower Solimões, lower Negro and upper Amazon rivers.

  abstract  = {Throughout the world, restoration of degraded areas (RDA) is not only a global but also a local challenge. In this context, the Brazilian government committed itself to restore 12 million hectares of forests by 2030. RDA monitoring customarily depends on extensive fieldwork to collect data on all individuals planted. As remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs) can reduce costs and time of fieldwork activities, studying this technology is therefore timely given. A crucial metric for RDA is the number of trees established in the area. Methods using RPAs on automatic tree counting showed good accuracy using algorithms based on the canopy height model (CHM), which is the difference between a digital surface model (DSM) and a digital terrain model (DTM). However, obtaining a DTM demands an extra computational processing step and may require field control points or manually delimiting objects on the surface. The study presented here proposes and evaluates a semi-automated methodology for counting trees directly on DSM in RDAs in the Amazon using RPA coupled with a red–green–blue standard photographic sensor. The DSM method obtained good overall accuracy and F-score indexes, superior to the CHM method for all study areas even when overall accuracy was low for both methods.},

  abstract  = {Plastic found in the coastal zone is a result of waste mismanagement. This material comes directly from offshore disposal or by fishing debris, other marine activities, and by marine currents and winds, as well as urban drainage systems and estuaries. Specifically, in the case of plastic pellets, which are spheres with 2–5 mm that constitute the raw material for the manufacture of plastic products, the Santos Port and the plastic factories in Cubatão city (Brazilian southeastern coast), are considered the main local sources for the São Paulo state coast. Consequently, the beaches most affected by this pollutant are those near Santos estuary, like Enseada do Guarujá beach. However, some questions are still open, such as: what are the mechanisms which control the pellets deposition, and which locations are most favorable for deposition on the beach? To answer these questions, a four-step research was carried out at Enseada beach: 1) Plastic pellets geodetic survey based on GNSS positioning; 2) Beach geomorphometric parameters (altitude, aspect, and slope) derived by Digital Elevation Model (DEM); 3) Strandline altitude estimated through wave climate and tide height; and, 4) Plastic pellets deposition Suitability Index (PSI). The joint analysis of the altimetric, geomorphometric and meteoceanographic aspects showed that the beach areas with altitudes higher than those calculated for the strandline (>2.06 m), slope ~ 3° and facing the same direction of the higher energy waves (157.5–202.5°) were more susceptible to pellet deposition. This indicates that the accumulation of this pollutant on the beach is controlled not only by its physical characteristics, but mainly by storm surge events. Besides, surveys with geodetic reference (fixed, univocal, and relatively stable on time) bring up altimetric information as a result of all interactions and can be compared with other beaches anywhere on the planet — thus contributing to a standardization of the survey methodology.},

A global Pluto digital elevation model (DEM) with a resolution of 300 m/px, created from stereoscopic pairs obtained by the New Horizons Mission, was used to extract the morphometric data of craters. Pluto’s surface was divided according to different morphometric characteristics in order to analyze possible differences in the impact dynamics and modification rate in each region. A Python code was developed, within the QGIS 3× software environment, to automate the process of crater outlining and collection of morphometric data: diameter (D), depth (d), depth variation, slope of the inner wall (Sw), diameter of the base (Db), and the width of the wall (Ww). Data have been successfully obtained for 237 impact craters on five distinct terrains over the west side of Sputnik Planitia on Pluto. With the collected data, it was possible to observe that craters near the equator (areas 3 and 4) are deeper than craters above 35°N (areas 1 and 2). Craters on the western regions (areas 2 and 3) contain the lowest depth values for a given diameter. The transition diameter from simple to complex crater morphology was found to change throughout the areas of study. Craters within areas 1 and 4 exhibit a transition diameter (Dt) of approximately 10 km, while Dt for craters within areas 3 and 5 the transitions occurs at 15 km approximately. The presence of volatile ices in the north and north-west regions may be the reason for the difference of morphometry between these two terrains of Pluto. Two hypotheses are presented to explain these differences: (1) The presence of volatile ices can affect the formation of craters by making the target surface weaker and more susceptible to major changes (e.g., mass waste and collapse of the walls) during the formation process until its final stage; (2) The high concentration of volatiles can affect the depth of the craters by atmospheric decantation, considering that these elements undergo seasonal decantation and sublimation cycles.},

  abstract        = {Forests worldwide are facing increasingly frequent climate extremes due to global warming. The negative effects of climate change on tropical forests have been extensively reported by both permanent plots and tree-ring studies that targeted forest's responses to climate. While they focus mostly on community and population levels, the effects of landscape heterogeneity on trees’ sensitivity to climate is often not accounted for, overlooking the diverse responses of individual trees to climate variation. We tested the hypotheses that trees may differ in sensitivity to climate and that some microenvironmental conditions may exert the role of climate-change refugia. We built the first tree-ring chronology of Amburana cearensis trees sampled across a Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest (SDTF) in Brazil. We ensure a robust tree-ring dating using dendrochronological methods and 14C dating of trees inhabiting various conditions characterized here through the seasonality of the local Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. At the population level, the standard tree-ring chronology suggests that tree growth depends on rainfall and temperature, leading to a common conclusion that drier and warmer conditions would impact interannual tree growth in the tropics. However, the cluster analyses revealed groups of individual trees with distinct growth sensitivities to climate. The most sensitive trees were the individuals located in the highly seasonal vegetation of the epikarst, in contrast to the complacent trees (non-sensitive to regular interannual climate variability) inhabiting the less-seasonal vegetation in the deep soil epikarst and valley. Based on these groups of trees, we built two mean chronologies and assessed their climate-growth relationships. In accordance with the individual analysis, the tree-ring chronology of complacent trees showed no association with wet season precipitation and only moderate association with temperature. The areas supporting these complacent trees of A. cearensis in the less seasonal vegetation correspond to a quarter of the entire sampling site. The climate buffering capacity of these refugia may only be compromised in years of climate extremes when all sampled trees share low growth rates during years with anomalous low rainfall and high temperature. Assessing individual’s climate sensitivity is therefore paramount for a comprehensive understanding of the heterogeneous responses of tropical forests to climate change. The hidden individual tree responses in the population can help identify priority areas of management in a rapidly changing environment.},

  abstract        = {Statistical susceptibility assessment is a common approach applied worldwide for shallow landslide studies. Identification of morphological and geological conditions is essential and still incipient to evaluate the susceptibility of landslide events in the Brazilian territory. This study aimed to develop and compare shallow landslide susceptibility scenarios based on a bivariate statistical evaluation of geological (lithology and structures) and morphological (curvature, elevation, slope, and aspect) factors in Caraguatatuba, northern coast of São Paulo State in Brazil. A compilation of geological factors from published maps was made, and morphological maps were created based on Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (30 m). A bivariate statistical application by the informative value method was used to create four susceptibility scenarios, and the validation was achieved using the area under the curve (AUC). The results indicated that lithology was the more relevant conditioning factor, followed by elevation and slope. The methodology used to determine the susceptibility was efficient (AUC values between 0.809 and 0.841). The susceptibility scenario comparison identified that conditioning factors with the highest informational value generated the most accurate mapping. This indicates that using several conditioning factors does not necessarily generate a better map. This study contributes to shallow landslides research from a methodological perspective, as it is the first analysis of its kind in Serra do Mar Paulista, which are continuously affected by mass movements. Open-source data were chosen to be used, focusing on methodological applicability in other regions of the country, since resources for landslide studies in Brazil are low.},

  abstract  = {There is little consensus on which environmental variables are best at predicting multiple dimensions of diversity. We ask whether there are common environmental correlates of diversity, despite ecological differences, across nine clades of plants and animals distributed along a single rainforest domain. For that, we compare the environmental correlates of species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and phylogenetic endemism. Taxon:Five clades of plants (Bromelioideae, Miconieae, Bertolonia, Cambessedesieae, and the Fridericia and allies) and four clades of animals (butterlies in the tribe Ithomiini, frogs in the genera Boana and Proceratophrys, and birds in the subfamily Thraupinae).
Using curated occurrence localities and phylogenetic data, we generated maps of (a) species richness, (b) phylogenetic diversity, (c) residuals of phylogenetic diversity regressed on species richness, and (d) phylogenetic endemism for all groups. We also compiled a set of 30 environmental descriptors, including records of current temperature and precipitation, climatic stability over time, and topography. Through a machine learning framework, we explored the environmental correlates of each of these diversity measures for each group.
The environmental variables used here were strong predictors of diversity for all studied groups. However, models for phylogenetic endemism had lower predictive power. Although patterns of diversity are different among groups, correlates of diversity are consistent across taxa. For both species richness and phylogenetic diversity, current precipitation and precipitation stability over time were consistently ranked among the variables that strongly correlate with diversity patterns. The correlates of phylogenetic endemism were less homogeneous across groups. The results suggest that including climate stability over time is important when predicting diversity measures that reflect historical components.
Investigating environmental correlates of diversity for multiple clades and diversity measures in a single geographic area allows for a better understanding of common patterns across taxa. This study shows that environmental conditions, particularly precipitation, are good predictors of the patterns of species richness and phylogenetic diversity-but not phylogenetic endemism-across different Atlantic Forest groups.},

Since remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) generate a panoramic high resolution and georeferenced view of the entire area of interest, this technology has high potential to improve the traditional FR monitoring methods. This study evaluates how low-cost RPA data may contribute to FR monitoring of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest by the automatic remote measurement of Tree Density, Tree Height, Vegetation Cover (area covered by trees), and Grass Infestation. The point cloud data was processed to map the Tree Density, Tree Height, and Vegetation Cover parameters. The orthomosaic was used for a Random Forest classification that considered trees and grasses as a single land cover class. The Grass Infestation parameter was mapped by the difference between this land cover class (which considered trees and grasses) and the Vegetation Cover results (obtained by the point cloud data processing). Tree Density, Vegetation Cover, and Grass Infestation parameters presented F_scores of 0.92, 0.85, and 0.64, respectively. Tree Height accuracy was indicated by the Error Percentage considering the traditional fieldwork and the RPA results. The Error Percentage was equal to 0.13 and was considered accurate because it estimated a 13% shorter height for trees that averaged 1.93 m tall. Thus, this study showed that the FR structural parameters were accurately measured by the low-cost RPA, a technology that contributes to FR monitoring. Despite accurately measuring the structural parameters, this study reinforced the challenge of measuring the Biodiversity parameter via remote sensing because the classification of tree species was not possible. After all, the Brazilian Atlantic Forest is a biodiversity hotspot, and thus different species have similar spectral responses in the visible spectrum and similar geometric forms. Therefore, until improved automatic classification methods become available for tree species, traditional fieldwork remains necessary for a complete FR monitoring diagnostic.},

We considered the following aspects: location of study areas, year and where the study was published, methods, thematic variables, source of the landslide inventory, and validation methods. The susceptibility studies are concentrated in Brazil’s south and southeast region, with the number of publications increasing since 2015. The methods commonly used are slope stability and statistical models. Validation was performed based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC). Even though landslide inventories constitute the most critical input data for susceptibility mapping, the criteria used for the creation of landslide inventories are not evident in most cases. The included studies apply various validation techniques, but evaluations with potential users and information on the practical applicability of the results are largely missing.},

  abstract  = {Digital elevation models (DEMs) provide fundamental depictions of the three-dimensional shape of the Earth’s surface and are useful to a wide range of disciplines. Ideally, DEMs record the interface between the atmosphere and the lithosphere using a discrete two-dimensional grid, with complexities introduced by the intervening hydrosphere, cryosphere, biosphere, and anthroposphere. The treatment of DEM surfaces, affected by these intervening spheres, depends on their intended use, and the characteristics of the sensors that were used to create them. DEM is a general term, and more specific terms such as digital surface model (DSM) or digital terrain model (DTM) record the treatment of the intermediate surfaces. Several global DEMs generated with optical (visible and near-infrared) sensors and synthetic aperture radar (SAR), as well as single/multi-beam sonars and products of satellite altimetry, share the common characteristic of a georectified, gridded storage structure. Nevertheless, not all DEMs share the same vertical datum, not all use the same convention for the area on the ground represented by each pixel in the DEM, and some of them have variable data spacings depending on the latitude. This paper highlights the importance of knowing, understanding and reflecting on the sensor and DEM characteristics and consolidates terminology and definitions of key concepts to facilitate a common understanding among the growing community of DEM users, who do not necessarily share the same background.},

  abstract         = {Landslide identification is important for understanding their conditioning factors, and for constructing susceptibility, risk, and vulnerability maps. In remote sensing this can be accomplished manually or through classifiers. This study compares three image classifiers (Maximum Likelihood, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM)) used in identifying landslides in Itaóca (São Paulo, Brazil). Two datasets were used: a RapidEye-5 (5 m) image and a Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) (12.5 m). Seven pixel-based classifications were produced, two for each classifier and a binary class that identified only landslides and non-landslides. One classification contained five spectral bands (5B), while the other contained six bands (6B) and included the slope derived from the DEM. The results were validated using Kappa index and F1 score. The SVM 6B classification achieved the best results among the validation indices used herein. It identified a landslide area of 399,325 m². The results contribute to landslide mapping in tropical environments using pixel-based classifiers. However, although the SVM classification was successful, only landslides with larger areas were captured by the algorithms, confirming the importance of conducting further analyses using images with finer spatial resolution.},

  abstract         = {Monitoring the vegetation structure and species composition of forest restoration (FR) in the Brazilian Amazon is critical to ensuring its long-term benefits. Since remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs) associated with deep learning (DL) are becoming powerful tools for vegetation monitoring, this study aims to use DL to automatically map individual crowns of Vismia (low resilience recovery indicator), Cecropia (fast recovery indicator), and trees in general (this study refers to individual crowns of all trees regardless of species as All Trees). Since All Trees can be accurately mapped, this study also aims to propose a tree crown heterogeneity index (TCHI), which estimates species diversity based on: the heterogeneity attributes/parameters of the RPA image inside the All Trees results; and the Shannon index measured by traditional fieldwork. Regarding the DL methods, this work evaluated the accuracy of the detection of individual objects, the quality of the delineation outlines and the area distribution. Except for Vismia delineation (IoU = 0.2), DL results presented accurate values in general, as F1 and IoU were always greater than 0.7 and 0.55, respectively, while Cecropia presented the most accurate results: F1 = 0.85 and IoU = 0.77. Since All Trees results were accurate, the TCHI was obtained through regression analysis between the canopy height model (CHM) heterogeneity attributes and the field plot data. Although TCHI presented robust parameters, such as p-value < 0.05, its results are considered preliminary because more data are needed to include different FR situations. Thus, the results of this work show that low-cost RPA has great potential for monitoring FR quality in the Amazon, because Vismia, Cecropia, and All Trees can be automatically mapped. Moreover, the TCHI preliminary results showed high potential in estimating species diversity. Future studies must assess domain adaptation methods for the DL results and different FR situations to improve the TCHI range of action.},

    abstract         = {Event-based landslide inventories are essential sources to broaden our understanding of the causal relationship between triggering events and the occurring landslides. Moreover, detailed inventories are crucial for the succeeding phases of landslide risk studies like susceptibility and hazard assessment. The openly available inventories differ in the quality and completeness levels. Event-based landslide inventories are created based on manual interpretation, and there can be significant differences in the mapping preferences among interpreters. To address this issue, we used two different datasets to analyze the potential of U-Net and machine learning approaches for automated landslide detection in the Himalayas. Dataset-1 is composed of five optical bands from the RapidEye satellite imagery. Dataset-2 is composed of the RapidEye optical data, and ALOS-PALSAR derived topographical data. We used a small dataset consisting of 239 samples acquired from several training zones and one testing zone to evaluate our models’ performance using the fully convolutional U-Net model, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor, and the Random Forest (RF). We created thirty-two different maps to evaluate and understand the implications of different sample patch sizes and their effect on the accuracy of landslide detection in the study area. The results were then compared against the manually interpreted inventory compiled using fieldwork and visual interpretation of the RapidEye satellite image. We used accuracy assessment metrics such as F1-score, Precision, Recall, and Mathews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). In the context of the Nepali Himalayas, employing RapidEye images and machine learning models, a viable patch size was investigated. The U-Net model trained with 128×128 pixel patch size yields the best MCC results (76.59\%) with the dataset-1. The added information from the digital elevation model benefited the overall detection of landslides. However, it does not improve the model’s overall accuracy but helps differentiate human settlement areas and river sand bars. In this study, the U-Net achieved slightly better results than other machine learning approaches. Although it can depend on architecture of the U-Net model and the complexity of the geographical features in the imagery, the U-Net model is still preliminary in the domain of landslide detection. There is very little literature available related to the use of U-Net for landslide detection. This study is one of the first efforts of using U-Net for landslide detection in the Himalayas. Nevertheless, U-Net has the potential to improve further automated landslide detection in the future for varied topographical and geomorphological scenes.},

  abstract         = {Landslides have caused tremendous damage to human lives and property safety. However, the complex environment of mountain landslides and the vegetation coverage around landslides make it difficult to identify landslides quickly and efficiently using high-resolution images. To address this challenge, this article presents a feature-based constraint deep U-Net (FCDU-Net) method to detect rainfall-induced mountainous landslides. Usually, the vegetation in the landslide area is severely damaged, and the vegetation coverage can indirectly reflect the spatial extent of the landslide. Meanwhile, the texture features of high-resolution images can characterize the surface environment of landslide hazards to a certain extent. We first introduce auxiliary features of normalized difference vegetation index and gray-level co-occurrence matrix into the proposed method to further improve the detection performance. Then, to minimize the information redundancy of these features and the image, we combine Relief-F and Deep U-Net to screen the optimal features to effectively identify accurate and detailed landslide boundaries. Compared with traditional semantic segmentation methods, the FCDU-Net method can capture fine-grained details in high-resolution images and produce more accurate segmentation results. We conducted experiments by applying the proposed method and other most popular semantic segmentation methods to a high-resolution RapidEye image in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The results demonstrate that the FCDU-Net method can achieve better landslide detection results than the other semantic segmentation methods, and the evaluation measures of Precision, F1 score, and mean Intersection-over-Union are as high as 88.87%, 81.17%, and 83.19%, respectively. Furthermore, we quantitatively analyze the effect of the convolution input window size on the performance of FCDU-Net in detecting landslides. We believe that FCDU-Net can serve as a reliable tool for fast and accurate regional landslide hazard surveys.},

Recent studies highlighted the potential of deep learning methods for automatic landslide segmentation. However, only a few works discuss the generalization capacity of these models to segment landslides in areas that differ from the ones used to train the models. In this study, we evaluated three different locations to assess the generalization capacity of these models in areas with similar and different environmental aspects. The model training consisted of three distinct datasets created with RapidEye satellite images, Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI), and a digital elevation model (DEM). Here, we show that larger patch sizes (128 × 128 and 256 × 256 pixels) favor the detection of landslides in areas similar to the training area, while models trained with smaller patch sizes (32 × 32 and 64 × 64 pixels) are better for landslide detection in areas with different environmental aspects. In addition, we found that the NDVI layer helped to balance the model’s results and that morphological post-processing operations are efficient for improving the segmentation precision results. Our research highlights the potential of deep learning models for segmenting landslides in different areas and is a starting point for more sophisticated investigations that evaluate model generalization in images from various sensors and resolutions.},

We present a protocol to evaluate canopy cover using low-cost RPA and a friendly computational environment. We tested the protocol in six FR projects in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. After processing the images automatically to generate the digital surface model and the digital terrain model, the canopy cover is measured in QGIS by considering height thresholds in the canopy height model. The results had F1 values higher than 0.9, which confirms a robust methodology that does not require specific computer science or remote sensing skills. Thus, low-cost RPA proved to be accurate and user-friendly in measuring the canopy cover, which improves monitoring during most FR stages. Such finding plays an important role in FR policies and future works must study a user-friendly protocol for measuring tree height via low-cost drones.},

  abstract         = {Spatial arrangement of distinct Amazonian environments through time and its effect on specialized biota remain poorly known, fueling long-lasting debates about drivers of biotic diversification. We address the late Quaternary sediment deposition that assembled the world's largest seasonally flooded ecosystems. Genome sequencing was used to reconstruct the demographic history of bird species specialized in either early successional vegetation or mature floodplain forests. Sediment deposition that built seasonally flooded habitats accelerated throughout the Holocene (last 11,700 years) under sea level highstand and intensification of the South American Monsoon, at the same time as global increases in atmospheric methane concentration. Bird populations adapted to seasonally flooded habitats expanded due to enlargement of Amazonian river floodplains and archipelagos. Our findings suggest that the diversification of the biota specialized in seasonally flooded habitats is coupled to sedimentary budget changes of large rivers, which rely on combined effects of sea level and rainfall variations.},

Three parametric (Mahalanobis distance, maximum likelihood and minimum distance) and three non-parametric (neural net, random forest and support vector machine) classification algorithms were tested in two Landsat scenes. The accuracy assessment was evaluated through a confusion matrix. Change detection of the landscape was analyzed through the post-classification comparison method. While maximum likelihood was more capable of highlighting errors in individual classes, support vector machine was slightly superior when compared with the other non-parametric options, these being the most suitable classifiers within the scope of this study. The main changes detected in the landscape were from forest to agro-pasture, from forest/agro-pasture to river, and from river to non-river, resulting in rock exposure. The methodology outlined in this research highlights the usefulness of remote sensing tools in follow-up observations of LULCC in the study area (with the possibility of application to the entire Amazon rainforest). Thus, it is possible to carry out adaptive management that aims to minimize unforeseen or underestimated impacts in previous stages of environmental licensing.},

Knowledge of relict landslides' location is vital to understand their mechanisms, update inventory maps and improve risk assessment. However, relict landslide mapping is complex in tropical regions covered with rainforest vegetation. A new CNN approach is proposed for semi-automatic detection of relict landslides, which uses a dataset generated by a k-means clustering algorithm and has a pre-training step. The weights computed in the pre-training are used to fine-tune the CNN training process. A comparison between the proposed and standard approaches is performed using CBERS-4A WPM images. Three CNNs for semantic segmentation are used (U-Net, FPN, Linknet) with two augmented datasets. A total of 42 combinations of CNNs are tested. Values of precision and recall were very similar between the combinations tested. Recall was higher than 75\% for every combination, but precision values were usually smaller than 20\%. False positives (FP) samples were addressed as the cause for these low precision values. Predictions of the proposed approach were more accurate and correctly detected more landslides. This work demonstrates that there are limitations for detecting relict landslides in areas covered with rainforest, mainly related to similarities between the spectral response of pastures and deforested areas with Gleichenella sp. ferns, commonly used as an indicator of landslide scars.},

The study areas belong to the São Paulo landslide risk mapping database and are named "CEU Paz" (CP) and "Parque Santa Madalena" (PSM). For each area, a lidar digital surface model (DSM) (2017) and two structure-from-motion multi-view stereo DSMs (2019 and 2022) built from drone imagery were combined using raster algebra to generate three digital surface models of differences (DoDs). The DoDs were able to highlight changes in vegetation cover and buildings, which are important characteristics for evaluating geological risks in an urban context. Still, they were unable to highlight changes in the ground surface. The results demonstrate that the method greatly supports monitoring, allowing for greater detail and ease of detecting large-scale changes. Even with promising results, this technique should be understood as one more tool for mapping risk areas without replacing fieldwork.},

Various mapping approaches based on Earth observation (EO) data have been used to identify different types of hazards. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) has been employed for EO-based landslide mapping worldwide. The development and application of efficient methods for recognition and mapping are essential to create standards for landslide inventory mapping, notably in Brazil where landslides are a frequent natural hazard. This study aims to detect landslide features and differentiate them into shallow landslides and debris flows using a semi-automated OBIA approach. RapidEye satellite images (5 m) were analysed and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) (12.5 m) and its derived products were integrated into the analysis to support the OBIA landslide mapping. The results show that the method is suitable for the recognition of this type of hazard and are potentially of use for local stakeholders and decision-makers in disaster management.},

These regions have a high functional diversity and require enlightened management to preserve their value for the future. In this study we assess changes to the São Paulo State (SE Brazil) coastline over the last 36 years. The study innovatively employs big data remote sensing techniques and multivariate statistical models to evaluate and generate erosion/accretion rates (1985--2021) relative to beach orientation and slope. Shoreline change rates have been obtained for sandy beaches at 485 one-kilometer-spaced transects. Our findings capture the complexity and heterogeneity of the analyzed coastline, at a regional and local scale. No association was found between shoreline changes and beach face orientation. Nonetheless, a dependency relationship was found between dissipative beaches with moderate to high accretion. Beaches facing south, with relative stability, were prone to sediment accumulation. Locations with slow accretion, like sandy spits and tombolo-protected beaches, were associated with dissipative beaches with moderate to high accretion. The southeast-oriented beaches are more prone to erosion due to storm waves from the south. Results provide a broad, fast, and relatively low-cost methodology that can be used in any sandy beach context, bringing essential information for coastal management and decision-making related to the use and occupation of the coastal zones.},

 abstract={Relatórios são recursos didáticos empregados para que os alunos apresentem, na forma de texto acadêmico, um tema relacionado à disciplina em curso. São, portanto, parte do processo natural de aprendizagem dos estudantes. Muitas vezes, no entanto, o aluno enfrenta maior dificuldade na elaboração do relatório em si do que na aprendizagem sobre o tópico da disciplina. Além disso, as informações úteis para a elaboração de relatórios de disciplina comumente se encontram dispersas na literatura geral sobre o tema. O objetivo principal deste guia é orientar o aluno de graduação em Geociências a desenvolver relatórios bem estruturados e apresentados, que abordem com textos de qualidade os tópicos relacionados à disciplina. Está aqui reunido o passo-a-passo para a organização e desenvolvimento de um relatório, incluindo dicas importantes para pesquisa bibliográfica, apresentação do texto, citações, formatação de tabelas, figuras e referências.},

  abstract = {A estimativa de biomassa, com base em dados de sensoriamento desempenha um importante papel a respeito da quantificação da matéria vegetal, tanto de florestas primárias quanto de florestas secundárias ou fragmentadas. Por isso, o objetivo central deste trabalho é mostrar a distribuição da biomassa vegetal e o fluxo de carbono na sub-bacia do rio Pirajibu em Sorocaba/SP. Como objetivo específico classificar os níveis de biomassa de acordo com o algoritmo de aprendizado de máquina Random Forest. As classes escolhidas para o treinamento foram: “Muito alta biomassa”, “alta biomassa”, “média biomassa”, “baixa biomassa” e "muito baixa biomassa”. Foram obtidas 100 amostras de treinamento. A classificação supervisionada foi realizada pelo método Random Forest, com 10 árvores de decisão e 5.000 de variáveis que foram selecionadas e treinadas. A classe muito alta biomassa foi encontrada em 4.833,34 ha (10,52\%), a classe alta foi identificada em 8.425,94 ha (18,34\%), a classe média biomassa em 12.026,28 ha (26,18\%), a baixa biomassa em 11.881,05 ha (25,87\%) e muito baixa biomassa em 8.753,80 ha (19,06\%). Foi avaliada a acurácia da classificação, a previsão de acurácia total chegou em 84\%. Para o índice CO2Flux, se obteve os valores de -0,43 para as áreas sem vegetação (área urbana), valores na faixa de 0,19 a 0,23 representam áreas de pastagem mais degradadas e com solo exposto, já os maiores valores de fluxo de CO2 > 0,32 mostram uma maior concentração de estoque de carbono, são regiões com vegetação robusta e saudável. A distribuição da biomassa para as classes muito alta, alta e média pode ser ainda maior considerando outros reservatórios de carbono, como os reservatórios abaixo do solo.},

  abstract  = {The Amazon region hosts the world's largest watershed spanning from high elevation Andean terrains to lowland cratonic shield areas in tropical South America. This study explores variations in optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) signals in suspended silt and riverbed sands retrieved from major Amazon rivers. These rivers drain Pre-Cambrian to Cenozoic source rocks in areas with contrasting denudation rates. In contrast to the previous studies, we do not observe an increase in the OSL sensitivity of quartz with transport distance; for example, Tapajós and Xingu Rivers show more sensitive quartz than Solimões and Madeira Rivers, even though the latter have a significantly larger catchment area and longer sediment transport distance. Interestingly, high sensitivity quartz is observed in rivers draining relatively stable Central Brazil and Guiana shield areas (denudation rate ξ=0.04 mmyr−1), while low sensitivity quartz occurs in less stable Andean terrains (ξ=0.24 mmyr−1). An apparent linear correlation between quartz OSL sensitivity and denudation rate suggests that OSL sensitivity may be used as a proxy for erosion rates in the Amazon basin. Furthermore, luminescence sensitivity measured in sand or silt arises from the same mineral components (quartz and feldspar) and clearly discriminates between Andean and shield sediments, avoiding the grain size bias in provenance analysis. These results have implications for using luminescence sensitivity as a proxy for Andean and shield contributions in the stratigraphic record, providing a new tool to reconstruct past drainage configurations within the Amazon basin.},

  abstract         = {Landslides are among the most frequent hazards in Latin America and the world. In Brazil, they occur every year and cause economic and social loss. Landslide inventories are essential for assessing susceptibility, vulnerability, and risk. Over the decades, a variety of mapping approaches have been employed for the detection of landslides using Earth observation (EO) data. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) is a widely recognized method for mapping landslides and other morphological features. In Brazil, despite the high frequency of landslides, methods for inventory construction are poorly developed. The aim of this study is to semi-automatically recognize shallow landslides in Ita&oacute;ca (Brazil) and evaluate the transferability of the approach within different areas in Brazil. RapidEye satellite images (5 m) and the derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), as well as a digital elevation model (DEM) (12.5 m) and morphological data, were integrated into the classification. The results show that the method is suitable for the recognition of this type of hazard in Brazil. The overall accuracy was 89%. The main challenges were the identification of small landslides and the exact delineation of scars. The findings validate the applicability of the approach in Brazil, although additional adjustments to the primary rule set might lead to better results.},
