<p>Suggestions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Consider preparing a summary paper that describes your research and gives an overview of the research results in the period of last 3-5 years. <strong>Focus on what is really novel about your approach and what still has to be done to reach the research objectives</strong>.</li>
  <li>Give concrete examples and illustrations of data analysis schemes, data sets, methodological concepts and results received.</li>
  <li>Concept papers and new research proposals are also welcome, assuming that they will evolve into full-length articles.</li>
</ul>
