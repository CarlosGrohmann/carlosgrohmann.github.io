  "content"  : "\n\nDEMIX (DEM Intercomparison eXercise) is a CEOS / WGCV / TMSG initiative supported by ESA as part of the EDAP+ project and by USGS. The objective of DEMIX is to compare global DEMs, and in particular, those at 1” arcsecond such as SRTM, ASTER GDEM, ALOS World-3D, NASADEM, COP-DEM, and FABDEM to allow different users to select the one that best suits their needs in their areas of interest. This choice is based on the results of criteria tested in different areas and evaluated using a “Wine contest” method where both quantitative and qualitative results can be freely combined for the candidate DEMs. The DEMIX project, developed out of a JRC workshop on Global DEM Benchmarking in 2019, started in July 2020 and is rolled out in three subgroups: (1) terminology and analytical basis, (2) algorithms and software, and (3) platforms and processing.\n\nThis DEMIX workshop is intended to present the results of this project, invite you to participate, and offer you access to the platforms and services that have been developed.\n\nThis workshop is co-organized by ISG:\n\n  Hannes Isaak REUTER (hannes@gisxperts.de )\n  Peter GUTH (pguth@verizon.net)\n  Mihai NICULITA (mihai.niculita@uaic.ro)\n\n\nand the CEOS Terrain Mapping Sub-Group:\n\n  Peter STROBL (Peter.STROBL@ec.europa.eu)\n  Clément ALBINET (Clement.Albinet@esa.int)\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n  Strobl et al., 2021a - THE DIGITAL ELEVATION MODEL INTERCOMPARISON EXPERIMENT DEMIX, A COMMUNITY-BASED APPROACH AT GLOBAL DEM BENCHMARKING - Int.

  "content"  : "Prepared by: Yu-Feng Ho (OpenGeoHub), Tom Hengl (OpenGeoHub) and Leandro Parente (OpenGeoHub)\n\nDigital Terrain Model or Digital Land Surface Model is a digital raster map representing elevations of terrain / bare surface. NASA’s SRTM DEM used to be one of the most famous environmental layers in early 2000’s. In recent years a number of global public topography datasets at high spatial resolutions (30 m) have been released, from which Copernicus GLO-30 and ALOS AW3D30 are the two that can be considered new-generation elevation models. Too many versions of (basically the same) environmental data layer and too many landing pages can often confuse users and decrease the overall usability of such data. To simplify access and usability of such data we are building global Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs that are based on ensembling of multiple data sources, including national/regional datasets. Here is how you can access this data and contribute to the project.\n\nTo comment on this article please use the Medium version.\n\nRationale for a new global Ensemble DTM\n\nIn recent years a number of global public topography datasets at high spatial resolutions (30 m) have been released including GLO-30 and ALOS AW3D, and that is on top of the existing NASADEM, ASTER DEM, MERIT DEM and similar. For a complete inventory of global datasets best refer to the OpenTopography data catalog. Too many versions of (basically the same) environmental data layer and too many landing pages can often confuse users and decrease the overall usability of such data. In addition, most DEMs produced from remote sensing observations are only surface models requiring removal of canopy and similar objects. On the other hand, users typically require a single (most current, most accurate, most complete) terrain model that can then be used to produce all morphometric and hydrographic terrain variables across borders (see e.g. Amatulli et al., 2018; Amatulli et al., 2022). Previously, the most global consistent Digital model of Terrain (bare-earth or land surface) was the MERIT DEM, available at 100 m resolution (Yamazaki et al., 2017). Guth and Geoffroy (2021) compared multiple global DEMs for the world vs LiDAR points from ICESat and concluded that GLO-30 is most likely the most accurate DEM to date, but again it is a surface model and canopy needs to be removed before it can be used as a DTM.\n\nRecently, a team at University of Bristol produced FABDEM (Forest And Buildings removed Copernicus DEM), basically the GLO-30 with buildings and forests removed by machine-learning. The correction algorithm was trained from a unique set of reference elevation from 12 countries, covering a wide range of climate zones and urban extents. Separate random forest models were implemented to estimate canopy height in forests and building height in urban areas and then GLO-30 subtracted height difference to produce FABDEM. This data set is described in detail in Hawker et al., (2022) and is available under CC-NC-SA license. An independent accuracy assessment of FABDEM is available in Dandabathula et al. (2022).\n\nLikewise, our results for the Continental Europe have shown that machine learning can be used to remove canopy and buildings, although some post-processing is still needed to create hydrologically correct DTMs (Hengl et. al., 2020). Furthermore, number of national DTMs are now also available for large areas, such as Australia DTM, and USA DTM. Overall, there is a need for an Ensemble DTM that can incorporate multiple valuable datasets and post-processing done by different groups (e.g. MERITDEM).\n\nTo help reduce the complexity of global elevation datasets and make the data more usable, we have started working on a multipurpose Ensemble DTM for the world. The methods and how to access data (available under CC-BY license as ARCO — Analysis-Ready Cloud Optimized global mosaic) are outlined below.\n\nBuilding the 30m Ensemble Terrain Model (EDTM30)\n\nAlthough terrain can be estimated using ICESat / GEDI points as reference training data, we test here using a more simple procedure for building a DTM that allows for faster updates and easy additions of new data: using lower 10% probability quantile. Advantage of having an inexpensive setup to update Ensemble DTM (EDTM30) is that we could possibly run nightly updates i.e. as soon as countries / regions submit locally produced terrain models.\n\nWhy 10% lower quantile? We basically assume that terrain heights are at the lower part of the distribution, so we simply derive lower 10% quantile from multisource data as shown below. We assume that, because canopy is difficult to remove and still remains even in MERITDEM and FABDEM (Dandabathula et al., 2022), deriving 10% lower quantile can further help filter out potential canopy remains.\n\nThis is of course a simplification and an arbitrary chosen number. Although computationally efficient, there is no guarantee that using lower 10% quantile will remove all canopy problems (e.g. all forests) hence it is important to first remove any pixels that significantly oscillate from MERITDEM. In addition, we here also assume that both AW3D and GLO-30 are the same quality, which might not be true for different parts of the world.\n\n\n\nA simple procedure used to derive an Ensemble estimate of the terrain elevation.\n\nWe run processing, described in the flow chart above, tile by tile (1000 x 1000 pixels). In summary the process works as follows:\n\n\n  \n    We first derive standard deviation (s.d.) using the list of DEMs (new map).\n  \n  \n    For GLO-30, ALOS, we remove all pixels where s.d. values are &amp;gt;6 m (60 dm) i.e. [sd(GLO, ALOS, MERIT, NDTM) &amp;gt; 6 m] AND/OR where canopy height is &amp;gt;2m; for those pixels we assign a NA value i.e. we assume these are DSM or erratic values. Note: for Canopy height a global 30 m layers is provided by UMD GLAD (Potapov et al., 2021).\n  \n  \n    We next derive a lower 10% quantile from the 5 values (GLO, ALOS, MERIT, NDTM). This is then the EDTM i.e. the most probable bare-earth elevation.\n  \n  \n    We also derive standard deviation using the 5 values; which can be used as the uncertainty map. If there is only one value of DEM in the list, we assign the value -1.\n  \n\n\nThe process of deriving the best estimate of DTM is fully documented and automated in this Python script. At the moment it can be used to generate an ensemble DTM within 5 hrs running on a fully parallelized HPC center with cca 1050 threads. Final mosaic of the world is a massive 200GB dataset and still takes significant time to compile a COG:\n\n\n\nDimensions and technical properties of the global mosaic at 30 m spatial resolution.\n\nA demonstration of the maps used and the results obtained (EDTM) is shown below:\n\n\n\nThree original input DEMs. GLO-30 and AW3D30 can be considered to be Digital Surface Models, hence canopy and buildings would need to be removed before it can be used.\n\nIn the last stage we compile all output layers as Analysis-Ready-Cloud-Optimized (ARCO) GeoTiff. This gives on the two final layers (1) EDTM in metre (m), and (2) standard deviation showing biggest discrepancies between AW3D, GLO-30, MERITDEM, and national DTMs. The two output COGs are shown below.\n\n\n\nEnsemble DTM in 30m.\n\n\n\nStandard deviation of Ensemble DTM in 30 m. This only shows how much the elevation differs from the multisource input data. Note that the highest errors can be noticed in areas with high complex relief i.e. Alps, Himalayas, but also in areas covered with dense vegetation (tropical forests).\n\nAccess and test using the Ensemble DTM (EDTM) of the world\n\nInterested to test the usability and accuracy of this data? To access this dataset seamlessly, without requiring to download the whole dataset (+200GB) or tiles that then need to be combined manually, we have further converted the global mosaic to COG files and uploaded them to our S3 repository.\n\nTo cite this EDTM please use the following reference:\n\n\n  Ho, Y.-F., Hengl, T., Parente, L., (2023).

To open this layer in QGIS and resample or subset / crop to area of interest, follow these steps: open QGIS -&amp;gt; “Layer” -&amp;gt; “Add Layer” -&amp;gt; “Add Raster Layer”, and click Protocol: HTTP(S), cloud, etc., paste the url from above at URL, and click “Add” button.\n\n\n\nPanel to add Ensemble DTM in QGIS (Layer » Add Layer » Add Raster Layer)\n\nTo derive local DTM parameters we advise using some equidistant projection e.g. the Equi7 gridding system. To extract part of the DTM best use the following code (e.g. for TILE:E038N093T1 in Equi7Grid or similar:\n\n\n  gdal_translate -a_srs ‘+proj=aeqd +lat_0=8.5 +lon_0=21.5 +x_0=5621452.01998 +y_0=5990638.42298 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs’ -projwin 3700000 9300000 3800000 9200000 https://s3.eu-central-1.wasabisys.com/openlandmap/dtm/dtm.bareearth_ensemble_p10_30m_s_2018_go_epsg4326_v20230221.tif ensemble_dtm_equi7_af_tile.E038N093T1.tif\n\n\nTo derive hillshade for this tile, QGIS provides Hillshade function. You can find it from QGIS -&amp;gt; “Raster” -&amp;gt; “Analysis” -&amp;gt; “Hillshade”.\n\n\n\nEnsemble DEM and derived Hillshade.\n\nFor python programmers, here is a jupyter script to access data, crop and generate hillshade in Python.\n\nReport a problem / help us improve the modeling framework\n\nThe OpenLandMap Github repository contains all information how the data was produced (see the repository). If you discover a bug, artifact, or inconsistency, it is always welcome to create a new issue using the Github repository and upload a screenshot or similar showing where the problem might be.\n\nIf you are aware of some national dataset that we could also add to the list of inputs for ensembling, please also register it as an issue. We only require that the input data license allows us to produce derivative datasets and to release them under an open data license (CC-BY, CC-BY-SA and/or ODbL). In addition, receiving your data as a GeoTIFFs with internal compression, also helps speed up the process.

  "content"  : "About 50 researchers from around the world attended the event, mostly by remote connection. The conference only featured oral sessions, with 44 contributions. Three invited keynote talks, by Michael Hutchinson (Australian National University College of Science), Igor Florinsky (Russian Academy of Sciences) and Marco Cavalli (CNR IRPI, Padua) enriched the content of the conference. Contributions were spread over three days, grouped by topic: “use of digital elevation, terrain and surface models” on day 1, “dynamics of earth surface: automated surface analysis and modelization” on day 2, and “modeling geomorphological processes” on day 3.\n\nAll of the sessions demonstrated that quantitative analysis of the Earth’s surface is closely related to the scale at which the surface itself is described/represented. Research on a global scale (e.g. aimed at the definition of accurate hydrographic networks) was counterbalanced by studies that focused on centimetric portions of Earth’s surface (e.g. small plates where accretion of tufa/travertine is studied). A related relevant topic was the comparison of lidar data with global (or quasi-global) DEMs and among different global DEMs, using different methods in many study areas. Explicit comparisons highlighted that, in selected areas representative of most existing settings, Copernicus DEM is the best performing; other comparisons in different areas and methods favored MERIT DEM. In all cases, lidar data represents the benchmark. Despite that, a discussion highlighted that peculiar applications may not be so sensitive to details represented in elevation data from lidar and/or SfM measurements to justify the much higher cost. There also have been an explicit proposal to merge global and local elevation data, already existing and available online for Europe.\n\nThis also lead to a discussion about the characteristic scale of terrain analysis, and a few presentations described multi-scale approaches as mature tools for a variety of application. Mainly, they described multi-scale methods for estimation of terrain roughness, curvatures, and landform mapping. The relationship between multi-scale approaches and characteristic scale may lead to need of optimization of numerical parameters for terrain analysis and classification.\n\nA few presentations focused on the geomorphological and physical meaning of maps derived from digital terrain models (such as curvatures) or on the definition of new functions aimed at representing the topology of surface water flow directions or the selection of features (derived from DEM) which are relevant in supervised classification applications.\n\nApplications of geomorphometry concepts and algorithms to other disciplines/topics have been numerous and included tectonics, soil erosion, landslide susceptibility, thermokarst phenomena, river forms, coastal habitat and coastal dunes, crevasses in polar ice, inundated areas, glacial cirques and volcanic eruptions.\n\nOne addition to the topics of this year’s edition of the conference was specifically commercial and industrial application. The scientific program actually included a few contributions explicitly reporting about industrial processes (microscopic analysis of silicon wafer “topography”) and commercial applications (deposition and analysis of submarine cables, rockfall susceptibility along the Italian national railway). Other contributions, even if not specifically commercial, highlighted the use of algorithms borrowed from computer graphics for terrain segmentation, and adaptation of general purpose software for marine geomorphometry. Moreover, commercial and industrial applications were one of the key topics – along with the role of local/global elevation data – for a proposed session at the upcoming European Geoscience Union General Assembly, prepared by a few of the participants of Geomorphometry 2021.\n\nContributions presented at the conference are available as peer-reviewed short papers from the book of Proceedings of the 2020 submissions (CNR Edizioni, Rome), or on Zenodo, for new submissions. Most of the presentations are also available as PDF and/or video recording at the conference website; a few of the contributions also have a link to published papers, either on the special issue “Advances in geomorphometry” in the journal Transaction in GIS.\n\n\nThe beautiful city of Perugia\n\n\nIn-person attendance to the conference\n\n\nHappy faces from all around the world\n"

  "content"  : "Within the OpenDataScience.eu (Geo-harmonizer) project we have recently produced an Digital Terrain Model for Continental Europe based on the four publicly available Digital Surface Models:  MERITDEM, AW3D30, GLO-30, EU DEM. This is basically an Ensemble Machine Learning approach where GEDI level 2B points (Level 2A; “elev_lowestmode”) and ICESat-2 (ATL08; “h_te_mean”) were used to train a multisource model to predict “most probable height of terrain” including the prediction errors per pixel.\n\nSo which of the four big global DEM’s is the best match with terrain heights? Our results indicate that it is the MERITv1.0.1 (originally available at 90-m, but was downscaled here to 30-m using cubic splines) followed by the AW3Dv2012 and GLO-30. This confirms that Yamazaki et al. (2017) have done an excellent work in filtering out canopy and artifacts in the original SRTM/AWD30 data.\n\nRead more about MERIT DEM in:\n\n\n  Yamazaki D., D.

  "content"  : "WEB APPLICATION and QUESTIONNAIRE at http://zgis205.plus.sbg.ac.at/PhysiographicClassificationApplication/default.aspx\n\nDear colleagues, We kindly ask for your help in evaluating the preliminary outputs of a global physiographic classification. The methodology has been designed for general purposes. We hope, however, that the results can be tuned to specific applications, by using the object attributes, without a need of running the classification again. Potential domains of application include Landscape Ecology, Ecology, Geomorphology, Geology, Hydrology, Soil Science, and Agriculture. Your evaluation would be useful in improving the current classification. The results of your evaluation will be part of a paper we intend to submit to a peer-reviewed journal. Classification results are embedded within a web application available at the following address\n\nhttp://zgis205.plus.sbg.ac.at/PhysiographicClassificationApplication/default.aspx.\n\nYou can visualize the results and let us know your opinion by filling in the form under the red button named ‘Please provide your feedback here.’ Apart of the classification itself, i.e. to which degree classes describe correctly given regions, we would like you evaluating the quality of object boundaries, i.e. to which degree boundaries match topographic discontinuities. After evaluation, both the database and the tool will be released for free download.\n\nPlease find below additional details on the methods and the web application.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe introduce an object-based method to automatically classify topography from SRTM data. The new method relies on the concept of decomposing land-surface complexity into more homogeneous domains. An elevation layer is automatically segmented and classified at three scale levels that represent domains of complexity by using self-adaptive, data-driven techniques. For each domain, scales in the data are detected with the help of local variance and segmentation is performed at these appropriate scales. Objects resulting from segmentation are partitioned into sub-domains based on thresholds given by the mean values of elevation and standard deviation of elevation respectively. The method is simple and fully automated. The input data consists of only one layer, which does not need any pre-processing. Both segmentation and classification rely on only two parameters: elevation and standard deviation of elevation. Unlike cell-based methods, results are customizable for specific applications; objects can be re-classified according to the research interest by manipulating their attributes. The tool can be applied to any regional area of interest and can also be easily adapted to particular tasks. Both segmentation and class thresholds are relative to the extent and characteristics of the dataset. Therefore, when applying the tool to regional/national levels, the results should be interpreted within the appropriate context (e.g. ‘High Mountains’ that may result from classification of Dutch territory are just the highest and roughest areas relative to this extent). To show the differences, we added the results of classification at the level of the Austrian territory to the web application.\n\nWeb application\n\nhttp://zgis205.plus.sbg.ac.at/PhysiographicClassificationApplication/default.aspx\n\nYou will find the following layers:\n\n\n  \n    Global_Level3. This is the finest scale at the global level. Object boundaries are transparent to enhance visualization at full extent;\n  \n  \n    GlobalLevel_objectsEvaluation. This is the same layer as above, with object boundaries on. It helps in evaluating the match with land-surface discontinuities;\n  \n\n\n3-5. Results of classification of the Austrian territory at all scale levels;\n\n\n  \n    Country Boundaries - for orientation;\n  \n  \n    ESRI_ShadedRelief - to visualize topography. Please be aware that this classification was obtained form SRTM data at approximately 1 km resolution, while the shaded relief map is much finer in some areas (see http://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/ESRI_ShadedRelief_World_2D/MapServer). Therefore, some discrepancies might be apparent.\n  \n\n\nFor each layer, except for the 7th, objects can be selected using the info button. After activating it, click within a polygon: a pop-up window will display the class label of the polygon, as well as its attribute table. Click on ‘Add to results’ at the bottom of the pop-up window: the polygon is selected. The attributes are presented in the table below; for details and equations see the eCognition Reference Book.\n\nThe following eleven attributes are listed for each object:\n\n\n  Area_Pxl: Area in pixels. 1 pixel is approximately 1sq km\n  Asymmetry: Relative length compared to a regular polygon\n  Compactness: Product of length and width, divided by the number of pixels\n  Elliptic_F: Elliptic fit. Describes how well an image object fits into an ellipse of similar size and proportions.\n  LengthWidt: Length/Width ratio of an image object\n  Local_Reli: Ratio. Max elevation minus Min elevation within a polygon\n  Mean_Layer: Mean elevation of cells within a polygon\n  Roundness: Describes how similar an image object is to an ellipse. It is calculated by the difference of the enclosing ellipse and the enclosed ellipse.\n  Shape_inde: Shape index. Describes the smoothness of a polygon border\n  Skewness_L: Skewness of elevation (based on cells within a polygon)\n  Standard_d: Standard deviation of elevation (based on cells within a polygon)\n\n\nThank you for your help!\n"

  "content"  : "The first 30 m resolution global ASTER-based DEM (GDEM) has recently been released. This is now the most detailed global GIS layer with public access (read more). The GDEM was created by stereo-correlating the 1.3 million-scene ASTER archive of optical images, covering almost 98% of Earth’s land surface (claimed 95% vertical accuracy: 20 meters, 95% horizontal accuracy: 30 meters). The one-by-one-degree tiles can be downloaded from NASA’s EOS data archive and/or Japan’s Ground Data System. The download of DEMs for large areas is at the moment difficult and limited to 100 tiles.\n\nI have downloaded some GDEM tiles for the areas in the Netherlands, Italy, Serbia and USA, and compared these with the most accurate LIDAR-derived DEMs (aggregated to 25 m resolution) available for the same area. The data used for comparison and shown in plot below can be obtained from here. I was interested to see how accurate is the GDEM and what are the main limitations of using it for various mapping applications.\n\nConceptually speaking, accuracy of topography (or better to say relief) can be represented by examining (at least) the following three aspects of a DEM:\n\n\n  Accuracy of absolute elevations (simply the difference between the GDEM and true elevation);\n  Accuracy of hydrological features (deviance of stream networks, watershed polygons etc. from true lines);\n  Accuracy of surface roughness (deviance of the nugget variation and/or difference in local relief quantified using e.g. difference from the mean value);\n\n\n\n\nFig: Comparison of the GDEM and LiDAR-based DEMs for four study areas: (1) fishcamp; (2) zlatibor; (3) calabria, and (4) boschord (all maps prepared in resolution 25-30 m).\n\nThe results of this small comparison show that:\n\n\n  The average RMSE for elevations for these for data sets is: 18.7 m;\n  The average error of locating streams is between 60-100 m;\n  Surface roughness is typically under-represented so that the effective resolution of GDEM is possibly 2-3 times coarser than the actual;\n\n\nIn addition, by visually comparing DEMs for the four case studies, you will notice that GDEM often carries some artificial lines and ghost-like features (GDEM tiles borders, vegetation cover etc.). The worst match between the GDEM and LiDAR-based DEM (reality) is in areas of low relief (boschord). Practically, GDEM looks to be of absolutely no use in areas where the average difference in elevations is &amp;lt;20 m. As the producers of GDEM themselves indicated: “The ASTER GDEM contains anomalies and artifacts that will reduce its usability for certain applications, because they can introduce large elevation errors on local scales”.\n\nIn summary, I can only conclude that (a) there is still a lot of filtering to be done with GDEM to remove the artificial breaks and ghost lines; (b) the effective resolution of the GDEM is probably 60-90 m and not 30 m, hence the whole layer should be aggregated to a more realistic resolution; (c) the first impression is that GDEM is not more accurate than the 90 m SRTM DEM, especially if one looks at the surface roughness and land surface objects. On the other hand, the horizontal accuracy of GDEM is more than satisfactory and GDEM has a near to complete global coverage, so that it can be used to fill the gaps and improve the global SRTM DEM. In addition, the GDEM comes also with a quality assessment (QA) map. Each QA file pixel contains either: (1) the number of scene-based DEMs contributing to the final GDEM value for each 30 m pixel (stack number); or (2) the source data set used to replace identified bad values in the ASTER GDEM.\n"

  "content"  : "About Perugia\n\n\n\nPerugia is the capital of the Umbria Region (the Green Heart of Italy), and is located in central Italy. The town is of Etruscan originand contains more than 160,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe Acropolis of Perugia (about 490 m a.s.l.) has been selected by the Etruscan people for the topographic arrangement on two contiguous hills, Colle del Sole and Colle Landone, and for the water resources.\n\nThe oldest urban center is enclosed by walls dating from the 3rd Century BC, that are themselves incorporated into a medieval fortification (14th Century).\n\nThe latter fortification encompasses the five villages (or districts) that have developed along the five main hill ridges towards the surrounding suburbs. This expansion took place in five directions, corresponding to the five Etruscan doors and has given the city a stellar shape that Renaissance architect Leon Battista Alberti compared to the fingers of a hand.\n\n\n\nIts rich history is well represented by the works of art housed in the most representative cities, and the numerous monuments that characterize the urban profile of its historic center. Among these monuments is first and foremost the Fontana Maggiore, built in the 13th Century. After construction of the aqueduct through which water was channeled to the center of the city, and which is still accessible today. In the Piazza IV November there is the Cathedral of San Lorenzo, which was completed during the 15th Century. The Palazzo dei Priori built between the 14th and 16th Century, is now the Town Hall of the Municipality of Perugia, and contains the National Gallery of Umbria, the region’s most important museum. Here visitors can admire works of artists such as Pinturicchio, Perugino, Pietro della Francesca, Gentile da Fabriano, and other work of arts covering a time span between the 13th and 19th Century.\n\n\n\nAmong the many other architectural works worthy of mention is Rocca Paolina, a fortress built by Pope Paul III in 1540, at the end of the Salt War, in which Perugia fought against the Papal State imposing taxes on the importation of marine salt. Only one wing remains of this monumental building, designed by Sangallo the Younger, one of the greatest military engineers of the 16th Century. The area under the building, the major underground citadel, is still accessible, however, having become one of the symbols of the city. It is now crossed by a path of escalators leading from the main bus terminal up to the city center.\n\nPerugia is the home of one of the oldest universities in Italy, founded in 1308, as attested by the Papal Bull issued by Pope Clement V certifying the birth of the Studium Generale. In addition to the University of Perugia is the University for Foreigners, founded in 1925, being the oldest university in Italy addressed to foreigners, and which specializes in the teaching and diffusion of the Italian language and culture worldwide.\n\nIn this highly suggestive scenario, and rich history, art and science surroundings, many cultural activities take place, making Perugia one of the most dynamic and attractive Italian cities. The best globally-known initiatives range from international music festivals (Umbria Jazz) to promotion of economic activities and crafts (UmbriaLibri), and from local confectionery production (Eurochocolate) to large conferences in the field of media and information (International Journalism Festival), and science (Perugia Science Fest or The Isle of Einstein).\n\nTourist guides\n\n  Perugia and its districts\n  Perugia Itinerary 1 and 2\n  Perugia Itinerary 3 and 4\n  Perugia Itinerary 5 and 6\n  Perugia culture and lifestyle\n\n\nReaching Perugia\n\nHere you can find some information about how to reach Perugia and contacts of the major Italian transportation companies.\n\nBy Bus (from Rome-Fiumicino  Airport to Perugia)\n\nIf you take the Sulga bus (www.sulga.it) from  Rome-Fiumicino Airport, you will arrive at Piazza Partigiani, the bus station in the Perugia city center.\n\nThe bus station at the airport is located in the parking area in front of Terminal 3, arrivals level. To find the bus station (Sulga bus) to Perugia please go outside the arrival gate and walk to your right until the end of terminals, following the “Bus Station” sign. You should see a series of bus parking spaces. The Sulga buses to Perugia arrive at the bus stops 35 or 36\n\nThere is no timetable for the Sulga busses available at the Rome-Fiumicino Airport. Please check the latest timetable in advance:\n\nSulga Busses Service\n\nThe one-way bus fare from Rome-Fiumicino Airport to Perugia or vice versa is about  € 22, and the roundtrip fare is about € 36 (valid for one month).

Two sheets were scanned by ANATech Evolution scanner with 400 DPI resolution, then georeferenced to the Gauss-Krüger coordinate system (7th zone) and converted to a point map using a semi-automated digitalization of contour lines (I/GEOVEC, Intergraph program module). The faults obtained during automated digitalization were removed by 3D editing of contour lines. The final DEM was produced using the ArcGIS 3D analyst: first a TIN was produced, which was then converted to a regular grid of 30~m resolution. This will be referred to as the topo-DEM in further text. The original points extracted from the topo-map (51,847 points) were sub-sampled (for computational efficiency) to 2051 points.\n\nA set of 1020 photogrammetric control points was provided with the help of the Geodetic governmental authority of Serbia. These were obtained throughout the orthophoto map production of the scale 1:1000 for local municipality. Aerial images were obtained using the RMK 21/23 analog camera with calibrated focal length f=207.96 mm. The average flying altitude was 1040 m. A stereoscopic model was produced using the WILD A10 analog stereo-restitution instrument and MapSoft2000 program package. The land-surface points were measured manually from the stereoscopic model with average lag of 15 m. This gave a total number of 46,021 points that were sub-sampled to 1020 points for faster processing. The estimated height accuracy of control points is 15 cm which allows us to use it as ground truth for the topo-DEM.\n\nData owner: Geodetic governmental authority of Serbia\nReference: Geostatistical modelling of topography using auxiliary maps\nLocation: Zlatibor, Serbia\n43° 43’ 0.0012” N,19° 41’ 60” E\nSee map: Google Maps\n\n\nAttachment:\n\nDownload\n"

Transformation (normalization) of slope gradient and surface curvatures, automated for statistical analyses from DEMs. Geomorphology 232(0): 65-77.\n\nPurpose and use:\n\nAutomated procedures are developed to alleviate long tails in frequency distributions of morphometric variables. They minimize the skewness of slope gradient frequency distributions, and modify the kurtosis of profile and plan curvature distributions towards that of the Gaussian (normal) model. Box-Cox (for slope) and arctangent (for curvature) transformations are used. The transforms are applicable to morphometric variables and many others with skewed or long-tailed distributions. It is suggested that such transformations should be routinely applied in all parametric analyses of long-tailed variables. Our Box-Cox and curvature automated transformations are based on a Python script, implemented as an easy-to-use script tool in ArcGIS.\n\nProgramming environment:  Python\nStatus of work:  Public Domain\n\nTransformation-Tools.zip\n"

  "content"  : "Short title:  GDEMerr\n\nA methodological framework for assessment of accuracy of a DEM product is described using four case studies (Booschord in the Netherlands, Calabria in Italy, Fishcamp in USA and Zlatibor in Serbia). Focus is put on evaluating the true accuracy of ASTER GDEM using LiDAR data aggregated to 30 m resolution. Three aspects of accuracy have been evaluated: (a) absolute accuracy of elevations (goodness of fit between true and GDEM elevations), (2) accuracy of stream networks (goodness of fit for buffer distance maps for stream networks), and (3) accuracy of surface roughness parameters (goodness of representation of nugget variation and residual errors).\n\nPurpose and use:\n\nProcedures are explained how to assess:\n\n\n  Accuracy of absolute elevations (absolute error);\n  Positional and attribute accuracy of hydrological features (streams, watersheds, landforms etc);\n  Accuracy of surface roughness (i.e. representation fo the short-range variation);\n\n\nThe script is attached to the paper indicated below.\n\nProgramming environment:  R / S language\nStatus of work:  Public Domain\nReference:  How accurate and usable is GDEM?

  "content"  : "The case study “Boschoord” (3024 ha) is a small area located in the province of Drenthe, in the northern part of the Netherlands. The Boschoord area is part of the Drenthe Plateau which is underlain by boulder clay deposited by the second last (Saalien) ice sheet. This rather complex genesis created a fragmented landscape in which hydrological differences are strongly linked to this polycyclic landscape development. What makes this dataset especially interesting is that it is an area of low relief, but with distinct geomorphological classes that have been mapped with relatively high accuracy (Koomen and Maas, 2004). The elevations range from 3 to 10 m above the sea level, with a standard deviation of 1.54 m; changes in topography are difficult to notice even in the field. This data set is available only for collaborators.

Both datasets show elevations measured with a high precision (±10-20 cm).\n- Geomorphological map (GKN50) – The map contains of 12 classes: Ground moraine (3L1), Low plains with ridges (3N3), Peat bog depressions (2R4), Cover sand undulated (3L5), Low plains/depressions without ridges (3N4), Low dunes + plains (3L8), Low plains/depressions without ridges (3N4), Cover sand undulated (3K14), Undulating ground moraines (3L1), Ground moraine (high) (3L2a), Low dunes + plains (3L9), Areas partially covered with cover sand (2M14), Low dunes (4K19), and Cover sand areas (2M13).\n- Topographic data – Includes all roads and infrastructure, land use classes and similar features from the TOP10VECTOR basic topographic map of the Netherlands (1:5000 scale).

Orthorectified photo was produced following the methodology explained in Rossiter &amp;amp; Hengl (2002). From the orthophoto we digitized on-screen land cover polygon map using the following classes: agricultural fields, fish ponds, natural forest, pasture and grassland, and urban areas. From the stereo-pairs we interpreted the generic landforms and then created a polygon map of geoforms (see also Rossiter &amp;amp; Hengl (2002)). Nine landform elements were recognised: summit, hill shoulder, escarpment, colluvium, hillslope, valley bottom, glacis (sloping), high terrace (tread) and low terrace (tread). From topomaps, we extracted contours and streams and water bodies. In the case of 1:50K the equidistance was 20 m in hilland and 5 m in plain, and for the 1:5K the equidistance was 5 m in hilland and 1 m in plain. From the 1:5K contours and geodetic points, the 5 m DEM has been derived using the ANUDEM (topogrid) procedure in ArcInfo and then resampled to the 25 m gird. The 30 m SRTM DEM (15’x15’ block) was ordered from the German Aerospace Agency (http://eoweb.dlr.de), then resampled to the 25 grid so it can be compared with the DEM25m.

  "content"  : "This page contains some basic instructions on how to prepare and submit a Camera Ready Copy (CRC) of the short papers for the Geomorphometry conference. We typically do not provide any technical support, which means that each author is responsible to format the article following the preparation guidelines and submit a CRC version of manuscript (see an example). Submissions that do not closely follow the manuscript preparation guidelines might be removed from the revision process. The publication process is illustrated in the graph below:\n\n\n\nTemplates:\n\nUse one of the following templates to prepare your 2-4 pages summary paper (read also the manuscript preparation guidelines):\n\ngeomph_letter_BLANK_0.doc\n\ngeomph_letter_BLANK.odt\n\nGeneral instructions:\n\n\n  Do not submit poorly prepared, incomplete and/or already used materials. Your paper will be reviewed by three members of the scientific committee.\n  Extended abstracts must be original works by the authors, not be currently under review in the same form by another outlet and not submitted elsewhere prior to the notification date.\n  Closely follow the manuscript preparation guidelines. Manuscripts that do not comply with the guidelines will be removed from the review process.\n  The paper has to be at least 2 and at most 4 pages long.\n  We accept only font-enbeded, high-quality graphics PDF versions of the manuscript. Do not submit MS Word documents or similar. To generate a PDF version of the article, please consider using CutePDF Writer or similar freeware.\n  Closely follow the indicated deadlines. We take no responsibility for delayed or incomplete reviews.\n\n\nSuggestions:\n\n\n  Consider preparing a summary paper that describes your research and gives an overview of the research results in the period of last 3-5 years. Focus on what is really novel about your approach and what still has to be done to reach the research objectives.\n  Give concrete examples and illustrations of data analysis schemes, data sets, methodological concepts and results received.\n  Concept papers and new research proposals are also welcome, assuming that they will evolve into full-length articles.\n\n"

  "content"  : "Invited lecturers\n\n\n\nTomasz Stepinski, Space Informatics Lab, University of Cincinnati, Ohio, United States\n\nTomasz Stepinski is the Thomas Jefferson Chair Professor of Space Exploration at the University of Cincinnati, is a widely recognized researcher in the fields of automated mapping of planetary and terrestrial surfaces, and the auto-analysis of big geospatial data. Stepinski obtained the M.Sc. degree in astrophysics from Warsaw University and the Ph.D. degree in Applied Mathematics from the University of Arizona. Before arriving to Cincinnati, he has served for 20 years as a staff scientist at the NASA-funded Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, Texas. He is a Director of Space Informatics Lab:\n\n“Doing Geomorphometry with Pattern Analysis”\n\nGeomorphometryis the science of quantitative land-surface analysis. However, commonly used analytical tools work well only on small study areas, whereas very large DEM datasets are now available. Examples include SRTM which is large due to its global geographical coverage and numerous LIDAR datasets which are large due to their fine spatial resolution. Over the last few years we have developed a pattern-based approach aimed at analysis of land-surfaces on continental or global scales using medium resolution DEMs or at local land surfaces using very high resolution DEMs. For very large datasets a local geomorphologic reality is best assessed from a broader spatial context rather than form a given location and its immediate neighborhood. To translate this insight into a practical analytic tool we translate local DEM data into spatial categorical pattern. A limited number of categories corresponding to landform elements are calculated using geomorphons method. Similarity between two local patterns is a core concept that underpins tools for large scale land-surface analysis. All tools are collected into a GRASS GIS-based toolbox GeoPAT which is in a public domain (http://sil.uc.edu/gitlist/). Using GeoPAT allows addressing questions which would be difficult to even formulate without it. These include search and retrieval of similar landscapes based exclusively on their content, supervised and unsupervised automatic mapping of physiographic units, and fast comparison of different models or surface features extractions methods in a fashion reminiscent of change detection in remote sensing. Specific examples featuring 30 m datasets covering the entire surface areas of Poland and the United States will be presented demonstrating all new tools and their practical applications. We will also demonstrate implementation of landscape search and retrieval as a GeoWeb application.\n\n\n\n\n\nPiotr Wężyk, Laboratory of Geomatics, University of Agriculture in Krakow, Poland\n\nAssist. Prof. at the Laboratory of Geomatics. Professional experience in international research and development projects on: GIS, Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing, Image Processing (Stereomatching, GEOBIA), GNSS and LiDAR technology applications in: management and monitoring of the environment, nature protection from natural hazards and forestry sector. Chairman of the SIG Forestry at EARSeL. Involved in several national-wide projects in Poland: training of using the aerial photos (PHARE PL 1997-98), Geoportal.gov.pl (INSPIRE), Information System of Country Protection Against Extraordinary Hazards (ISOK) and co-operation with: Ministry of Environment, Head Office of Geodesy and Cartography, Polish State Forest, General Directorate of Nature Protection, National Parks and the public administration bodies.\n\n“Making the invisible visible – the DTM modelling in complex environments”\n\nForests and water are the basic environments on maps from the early days of cartography but by its complexity very difficult for detailed mapping.The wooded areas a specially those covered by multi-layer evergreen dense vegetation are a challenge for detailed modelling of DTM because of lack of ground truth data. The traditional photogrammetry approach and the GNSS survey is very limited due to the dense canopy and multipath errors. Water bodies like: sea, lakes or rivers cause serious problems with measurement of the bed. Therefore the state of the art technologies are developed for wide-area precision mapping and 3D modelling. In the lecture the overview of the different remote sensing methods will be given through aerial and satellite stereo-photogrammetry, radar and specially the Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) technology will be presented (topographic and bathymetric scanners). A special part of the presentation will concern the integration of ALS with Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) technology. The precise DTM models besides his role in geomorphology, archaeology or landslide monitoring are crucial for the quality of the generation of derived products like normalised Digital Surface Models (nDSM). Those models (nDSM known also as Crown Height Models= CHM ) are very important e.g. for: foresters, ecologist and landscape planers. DTM mapping of river and see bed can deliver very important information concerning the natural environments and different hazards a specially when integration of multi-source information may led to continuous surface data. The using of TLS and handy scanners opens up new possibilities to capture and 3D modeling of underground surfaces such as caves or mines that can be integrated with DTM based on ALS.\n\n\n\n\n\nManfred Zink, Microwaves and Radar Institute, German Aerospace Center, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany\n\nSince the late 80s Dr. Manfred Zink has been working for DLR’s Microwaves and Radar Institute and has pioneered calibration techniques for both air- and spaceborne SAR sensors. He was the Lead Calibration Engineer for the SIR-C/X-SAR space shuttle missions in 1994 and for the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission in 2000. From 2000 to 2005 he was with the European Space Agency (ESA), where he was responsible for the calibration/validation of the ASAR onboard the ENVISAT satellite and later took the position of the Principal System Engineer for ESA’s TerraSAR-L Program. In 2005, he returned to the Microwaves and Radar Institute, where he is currently heading the Satellite SAR Systems Department and managing the TanDEM-X Mission and Ground Segment.\n\n“TanDEM-X: A Challenging Radar Mission for Generating a New Earth’s Topography”\n\nTanDEM-X is a challenging mission. It consists of a synthetic aperture radar interferometer with two almost identical satellites flying in a closely controlled formation. With a typical separation between the satellites of 150 to 500 m a global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with 2 m relative height accuracy at 12 m posting is being generated. While data acquisition has been finished mid-2014, the processing of the global TanDEM-X DEM will be concluded by end 2015. Final DEMs for most of Australia, a large part of North America, South America, Africa and Siberia are already available for scientific and commercial applications. The results achieved so far are well within the expected performance for the global DEM. Beginning in October 2014, a 15-month science phase of the TanDEM-X mission offers the opportunity to generate DEMs with even higher accuracy for selected areas, and to explore and demonstrate the new scientific applications of this unique mission.\n\n\n\n\n\nChristopher Crosby, Open Topography Group, United States\n\nhristopher Crosby is Geodetic Imaging and OpenTopography Project Manager at UNAVCO in Boulder, CO, USA. Trained as a geologist, Crosby has worked on paleoseismology, earthquake geology, and active tectonics research in the western US, Caribbean, and Central Asia. He has expertise in the development of cyberinfrastructure to manage and improve access to earth science data and processing tools. Crosby is co-founder, co-PI, and manager of OpenTopography (http://opentopography.org), an NSF-funded portal to high-resolution topography data and tools. In addition, he manages the terrestrial laser scanning and InSAR programs at UNAVCO, a non-profit university-governed consortium funded by the US National Science Foundation and NASA, that facilitates geoscience research and education using geodesy.\n\n“OpenTopography: Enabling Online and On-Demand Access to High-Resolution Topography Data for Natural Hazards”\n\nOpenTopography (http://www.opentopography.org) is a U.S. National Science Foundation-funded web-based system designed to democratize access to earth science-oriented lidar and other topography data. OpenTopography provides free, online access to lidar data in a number of forms, including point clouds and associated geospatial tools for customized on-demand processing and analysis. Topographic data are co-located with processing tools to enable users to generate digital elevation models, and derived geomorphometric products and visualizations. This presentation will highlight examples of OpenTopography hosted-data used in natural hazards research and event response, and will also discuss strategies being explored to facilitate rapid and scaleable processing of topographic data following a natural disaster.\n\n\n\n\n\nTomasz Niedzielski, Institue of Geography and Regional Development, University of Wrocław, Poland\n\nTomasz Niedzielski works as a Professor at the University of Wrocław, Poland, and serves as a Head of Department of Geoinformatics and Cartography. He is an expert in modelling and prediction of numerous processes in Earth sciences, with a particular emphasis put on applications of mathematical models in hydrology, physical oceanography and geophysics. His expertise includes real-time systems for forecasting peak flows and for predicting dynamics of sea surface topography. Prof. Niedzielski’s background is applied mathematics and geography. He gained his doctoral and habilitation degrees at Warsaw University of Technology and the University of Wrocław. He also worked at the University of Aberdeen in the UK as well as in Polish research institutions: the Space Research Centre of Polish Academy of Sciences and Wrocław Centre for Networking and Supercomputing of Wrocław University of Technology.\n\n“Hydrological forecasting in real time: an experimental integrated approach”\n\nOne of the roles of geosciences is to provide the society with efficient tools that may diagnose or predict various environmental hazards. Floods are among such events, and hence there is an ongoing need to develop and improve hydrological models. However, especially in mountainous catchments which respond quickly to extreme rainfall, the need covers not only predictive models but also real-time systems that produce and publish up-to-date predictions with sub-hour update frequency. This includes forecasting both the hydrograph and inundation. The objective of the talk is to present a novel approach that integrates the real-time system for forecasting hydrograph, known as HydroProg, with the following two elements: the real-time inundation model that simulates the flood extent on the top of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and the on-demand monitoring of inundation using the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Although skills of the hydrograph prediction models are relatively easy to assess, the problem arises when we want to evaluate the performance of inundation models. This can be done as a near real-time procedure, initiated automatically when the HydroProg and the associated inundation model produce flood alert, making use of the UAV for oblique photogrammetry. The UAV-taken aerial photographs enable production of orthophoto images which are utilized to check the accuracy of spatial predictions of flood extent. The prototype of the comprehensive integrated system is presented during the talk, and the results are based on the experimental implementation of the HydroProg system in the Nysa Kłodzka River basin (SW Poland).\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve Kopp, Environmental System Research Institute, Redlands, CA, United States\n\nSteve Kopp is a Program Manager on the Geoprocessing and Spatial Analysis team at Esri where he has been designing, testing, and writing about terrain analysis and diverse applications of GIS technologies for 25 years. He is an author, coauthor, and technical editor for numerous books, software manuals, and refereed journal articles related to spatial modeling, map projections, atmospheric science, and water resources, including Digital Elevation Model Technologies and Applications: The DEM Users Manual.\nHis areas of specific research interest include spatial modeling, surface hydrology, and dissemination of spatial science to a broadening community. Mr. Kopp has a Masters degree in Geography from Indiana State University with an emphasis in remote sensing and hydrology.\n\n“Expanding the reach of Geomorphometry through Web GIS”\n\nThe explosion of easily accessible spatial data and apps is transforming the how scientists and citizens perceive geography. Nearly everyone with internet access now works with maps almost daily. For geospatial professionals, it has become easier to share their authoritative data with other scientists. It is now possible to create reliable, scalable web services, with no programming and limited IT skills. Access to better data is allowing scientists to create better models and forecasts. Web services, in this case analytic or geoprocessing services, provide a mechanism for modelers to easily share their authoritative modeling with others. An emerging pattern is to combine these services into simple web applications tailored for specific users. In the case of Geomorphometry use cases such as landslides and floods, such applications leverage web services to plan for a possible disaster event, inform the public about possible risk, and support timely response following a disaster.\n\n\n\nKeynote Speakers\n\n\n\nMarco Giardino, School of Natural Sciences, University of Torino, Italy.\n\nAssociate Professor at the School of Natural Sciences. Previously, researcher at the National Research Council. His studies in Applied Geomorphology (geothematic mapping, remote sensing) concern geodiversity and evolutionary processes of the alpine relief, the assessment of natural hazards and risks. He is also devoted to the protection of geoheritage and to Earth Science education. His partnerships: USGS Geologic Hazard Team; Université de Savoie; University of Lausanne, Tripura University, Simon Fraser University. He is a member of the Italian Glaciological Committee, secretary of the Association of European Geological Societies (AEGS), co-chair of the IAG/AIG (International Association of Geomorphologists ) Working Group on Landform Assessment for Geodiversity, and coordinator of the “geoNatHaz” project of EU-Canada university co-operation on natural hazards and risks.\n\n“Multidimensional approach to natural instabilities in mountain areas: how geomorphometry can improve both hazard modelling and risk perception”\n\nNatural hazards and risks assessment in mountain areas is a challenging issue because of on going environmental changes associated with climate change and increasing impacts on infrastructure and socio‐economic and cultural activities. Since behaviour on mountain communities towards natural hazards is mostly influenced by the “perceived risk” than the “real risk”, research should be addressed both to accurate hazards modelling and targeted applications of new technologies for diffusion of scientific results. Geomorphometry can be useful for both accurate hazards modelling and targeted risks management. By means of a multidimensional approach (local, regional) to natural hazards and risks applied in mountain areas of the European Alps and the Canadian Cordillera, the paper will demonstrate the strategic roles played by accurate DEM derived data and targeted analytical tools by geomorphometry for:\n1) enhanced accuracy of models of diverse geoenvironmental processes and\n2) improved knowledge on natural hazards and awareness on natural risks\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkus Metz, GRASS Development Team, Fondazione Edmund Mach, Trento, Italy\n\nMarkus Metz studied biology in Cologne, Berlin, Munich and Oldenburg and finished his PhD in animal behaviour in 2005. As freelance GIS consultant he participated in various projects in southern Africa (evaluation of endangered ecosystems, soil mapping, hydrological modelling). Since 2011 he holds a postdoc position at the Fondazione Edmund Mach in Italy, developing climatic models for risk assessment of vector-borne diseases. He joined the GRASS GIS development team in 2007, maintaining modules for hydrological modelling and the GRAS GIS vector engine.\n\n“Searching for water: hydrological modelling concepts in GRASS GIS”\n\nThe lecture will start with a brief introduction to pre-processing of digital elevation models (DEM) with an emphasis on DEM preparation for hydrological modelling. The standard procedure for 2D hydrological modelling will be explained, as well as the deviation of some GRASS GIS modules from this standard procedure. The results of DEM-based 2D hydrological modelling (flow directions, surface flow accumulation, basin delineation) are the basis of further analytical steps. The lecture will then describe stream network extraction in GRASS GIS and illustrate methods for further stream network analysis. Finally, the capabilities of GRASS GIS to process big data will be illustrated.\n\n\n\n\n\nLucian Drăguţ, West University of Timisoara, Romania\n\nPhD in geography is a lecturer at the West University of Timisoara, Romania. He has 15+ years of professional experience in teaching and research in Romania, Austria, United States, Japan and Canada. He is a specialist in Geographic Information Science, Geomorphometry, and Remote Sensing. Results of his research have been published in Geomorphology, Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, International Journal of Geographical Information Science, Computers &amp;amp; Geosciences, Journal of Archaeological Science, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, and book chapters. He has received two prestigious fellowships- Fulbright and Marie Curie- and served as a member in the Scientific Board of the Earth Sciences Committee, Romanian National Research Council.\n\n“Object-oriented geomorphometry”\n\nThis contribution provides an overview of object representation from digital elevation models in the context of specific geomorphometry and geomorphological mapping. It is shown that object representation (e.g. as landforms) in geomorphometry is a particular case of geographic data modelling, thus sharing a difficult question: how to discretize fields in order to represent them? Translation from continous models of altitude and its derivatives to landform divisions is challenged by scale and purpose. The current approaches to delineation of landforms are reviewd, with an emphasis on land-surface segmentation and its potential to geomorphometry.\n"

The airport is located in the city, 7 km from the city centre, in the vicinity of the route leading directly to the major city points. There are bus stops right in front of the passenger terminal and in its close vicinity. Currently four bus lines run directly between the airport and city center, one of which – L – is an express line connecting the airport with the main train station. The line 48, 59, L runs every 30 minutes. The night line (11:00 pm-5:00 am) 242 runs also to the city centre. Tickets (~1€ for 15 min) are available to buy at kiosks and ticket machines. Taxi ranks are located next to the arrival terminal. Course to city centre cost less than 12€ during daytime. Rental cars are available at the airport. More information at www.airport-poznan.com.pl\n\nBy train and bus\n\nAll trains coming to Poznań stop at Poznań Main Railway Station (Poznań Główny) in the city centre, walking distance from several hotels (see below). There are direct Euro-City and Inter-City train connections from Warsaw, Minsk, Kiev, Moscow, and from Berlin, Hannover, Brussels, Amsterdam. Bus Station is located next to the Poznań Main Railway Station . It provides both domestic and international transport services. In most cases participants coming by railway or bus do not need transportation to reach hotels. However in any case they can reach any point in the city using tram or bus - in the vicinity of the main railway hall there are bus and tram stops for several lines. Also night buses approach the stop. Taxi ranks are located next to the Main Hall and the West Railway Station exit. More at  http://beta.rozklad-pkp.pl/en\n\nBy car\n\n\nMain roads\n\nParticipants driving from East (Warsaw) and West (Berlin) can reach Poznań using A2 highway (via toll) or national route no. 92. From south (Praque) and north (Gdańsk and Szczecin) national route 5 or 3 and national route 11. All national routes except A2 are toll-free. The city centre is covered by the Parking Zone. Fare is collected for each vehicle parked within the zone. Drivers pay the parking fee in parkingmeters located along streets in the city centre. The Parking Zone borders are marked with B-39 road sign. We also offer a free parking at the Conference Veune since Sunday till Saturday.\n\nURBAN TRANSPORTATION\n\n\nRed dosts mark locations of selected hotels/hostels\n\nPoznań has very good system of public transportation including trams, fast trams and buses. Buses and trams run regularly from 4:30am to 11:00pm (day service) and from 11.00pm to 4.30am (night service). Tickets for the public transport may be purchased in the Central Tickets Sales Points, newspaper kiosks, stores and super-markets, ticket machines, as well as on board in some trams and buses. there is direct fast tram connection from the city center to the Geo-Campus. Estimate time required to reach campus from city center does not exceed 30 minutes during the rush hours.

All the coffees (8 coffee breaks), lunch (4 days) and cocktails (3 nights) will be included in the registration fee.Sponsorship and support:The organizers will look for a sponsorship but, in any case, the conference registration will not be higher than 300 euros. The registration prize will include the material and documentation, coffee and meals.Any special reason we should come to...A special issue of the&amp;nbsp;Boletín Geológico y Minero&amp;nbsp;(an Earth Sciences Journal published by the Geological Survey of Spain since 1874) will be printed with selected papers. The proceedings of the Conference will be provided on a CD with ISBN, the first day of the Conference.&amp;nbsp;Geomorphometry workshop has never before been organised in Spain.Photographs:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n\n#2Wageningen University, the NetherlandsLocal organizers:Tomislav HenglISRIC — World Soil InformationNiels AndersEnvironmental Sciences Group, Wageningen University, the NetherlandsHosting institution(s):ISRIC — World Soil Information / Wageningen University, the NetherlandsVenue:Forum building. The conference hall can accommodate &amp;gt;150 people and is equipped with top multimedia facilities. There are facilities for parallel and poster sessions. Wageningen University is located on the WUR campus that consists of a number of modern buildings built in the last 2-10 years.Town and surrounding:Wageningen (ca. 45,000 habitants) is an university town in the centre of the Netherlands with over 10,000 students and some 5000 research and education staff. It is thePreferred dates:13-17 July 201524-28 August 2015Arrival / local transport :Wageningen is about 1 hour away from the Schiphol International airport. Schiphol is the third biggest European airport with direct flights to all major cities in the world.&amp;nbsp;Buses from Ede-Wageningen station to Wageningen drive frequently and take about 20 minutes. We would also organize free bikes for each workshop participant that wants one &amp;nbsp;:)Conference theme (leitmotief):High-resolution and multiscale DEMs for environmental modellingLogistical information:Forum building has a student restaurant and a cafeteria (the building daily hosts 3000-4000 students!). Organized meals can be provided through an university hired company at subsidized price. A barbeque on campus is planned at the beginning of the conference (night before). Considering the accommodation, Wageningen offers various possibilities, ranging from budget to four-stars hotels. In particular, the organizers can book rooms at special rates (70-80 euro) in hotel Hof van Wageningen, which in fact can also host the workshop if this is preferred (no commuting between hotel and workshop site, closer to town centre). The conference dinner will most likely be held at&amp;nbsp;Castle Doorwerth&amp;nbsp;(dates back to the 13th century, authentic interior and not far — cycling distance! — from Wageningen).Sponsorship and support:ISRIC will offer it&#39;s New multimedia World Soil Museum to host the geomorphometry workshops. Students will get a 50% reduction on the registration fees.Any special reason we should come to...ISRIC has the largest world soil database and library and is actively involved in digital terrain modeling through projects like SOTER or WorldGrids.org. Wageningen University and Research Centre is one of the leading European research centres in the field of Environmental Sciences. The Alterra Soil Geography team has developed and applied DEM processing methods for many years. In 2013, ISRIC will open its&amp;nbsp;New World Soil Museum&amp;nbsp;that can be used to host some of the Geomorphometry 2015 workshops.&amp;nbsp;Geomorphometry workshop has never before been organised in the Netherlands.Photographs:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n\n#3Institute of Geoecology and Geoinformation, Poznan, PolandLocal organizers:Grzegorz RachlewiczHead of Institute of Geoecology and Geoinformation, vice-chair of the Association of Polish GeomorphologistsZbigniew ZwoliñskiInstitute of Geoecology and Geoinformation, Chair of the IAG/AIG WG on Landform Assessment for GeodiversityJaroslaw JasiewiczInstitute of Geoecology and GeoinformationHosting institution(s):Institute of Geoecology and Geoinformation, Poznañ, Poland /Association of Polish Geomorphologists, International Association of Geomorphologists Working Group on Landform Assessment for GeodiversityVenue:Modern building of Faculty of Geographical and Geological Sciences.

There are two restaurants for more than 150 persons. There is an in-place catering company with long term experience in domestic and international conference events. Average meal price in a regular restaurant typically does not exceed 7-10 Euro per person.Sponsorship and support:Access to conference halls, computer labs and the entire infrastructure at no cost to all participants. Rector of the Adam Mickiewicz University and the President of the City of Poznañ will be invited for official patronage which might bring additional benefits and possibilities. The Association of Polish Geomorphologists will provide organizational help. There will be also help from geoinformation student volunteers.Any special reason we should come to...Poznañ offers quality accommodation services at relatively low cost. As Poznañ is the seat of International Fair Trade and former organizer of UN Climatic Change Conference (2008) it has one of the best hotel network in Europe. Geomorphometry workshop has never before been organised in Poland. On the other hand,&amp;nbsp;Poznañ&amp;nbsp;has already hosted a number of international geomorphological conferences e.g. in 1963 and 1976&amp;nbsp;(INQUA).Photographs:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n"

  "content"  : "The Geomorphometry elections are held every two years during the Geomorphometry.org society meeting (Geomorphometry conference series). The results of voting (including the best paper awards and nominations for the next conference) are typically announced by the Chair and vice-Chair on the last day of the conference, and published on the society website (the website is the only official source of information).\n\nRules and regulations:\n\n\n  Only full members (participated in at least one Geomorphometry.org event in the last 6 years) registered via the website are eligible to vote. The voting is done via geomorphometry.org website.\n  Voting is anonymous, but the results are published in a table format (names are masked out). If you write down yourd IP and exact time during the voting, you can control that your vote is correct.\n  Nominations for chair (senior staff; &amp;gt; 15 years of work experience) and vice chair (junior staff; &amp;lt;15 years of work experience) are generated automatically from the Scientific Committee list (active conference paper reviewers). The highest ranked candidates are then invited to lead geomorphometry. If the nominated candidate does not accept the task, then the next on the list is invited.\n  The role of Chair/Vice-chair is to: (a) ensure continuity of the geomorphometry events, (b) help the local hosts with organization of the conferences and workshops, (c) regularly update members via website and newsletter (at least once in 3 months) about news and events, (d) organize society meeting and elections at least every 2 years.\n  The deadline to vote for Geomorphometry related issues is indicated on the society website. Typically, there are no extensions of this deadline.\n  The Chair and Vice-chair are responsible to publish the results of elections (new Chair and Vice-chair, best paper awards, nominations for the next conference) before the end of the Conference and keep the society up-to-date about any major decisions.\n  The same Chair can only be elected for 2 consequtive elections (hence for a maximum of 4d years). The same Chair and Vice-chair can be re-elected as long as their is at least 2 years of break between the mandates.\n  New Chair and Vice-chair can request changes to these rules. To ensure continuity of the society, each amendment needs to receive &amp;gt;50% votes from the Geomorphometry members at the Geomorphometry elections.\n\n\nPrevious elections:\n\n\n  Geomorphometry 2011 (Redlands)\n  Geomorphometry 2009 (Zurich)\n\n"

  "content"  : "\n\nGeomorphometry followers may be interested in the new version of my TauDEM (Terrain Analysis Using DEMs) software available from http://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem.\n\nTauDEM is free and open source. It comprises a set of Digital Elevation Model (DEM) tools for the extraction and analysis of hydrologic information from topography as represented by a DEM.\n\nThe new version, TauDEM 5.0 takes advantage of parallel programming using the message passing interface (MPI) and achieves improved runtime efficiency and the capability to run larger problems.\n\nTauDEM includes functions for the development of hydrologically correct (pit removed) DEMs, calculation of flow paths, contributing area, stream networks and other flow related derived information.  Its unique features are that it uses the D-Infinity flow model for evaluation of information derived from dispersed flow over hillslopes and provides objective methods for the determination of stream network delineation thresholds.\n\nThe parallel version (TauDEM 5.0) has been completely restructured as a set of command line functions in standard C++ using MPICH2.  The source code has been compiled for both PC’s and parallel clusters.  GeoTiff is used as the input/output file format so that the command line functions that provide core functionality are platform independent.  TauDEM does include an ArcGIS toolbox Graphical User Interface (for ArcGIS 9.3.1) that has been recoded to use system calls to these command line executables.\n\nThe development of TauDEM 5.0 was supported by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center under contracts W9124Z-08-P-0420 and W912HZ-09-C-0112.\n"

  "content"  : "The 4th international conference + workshops on Geomorphometry / Digital terrain modelling and analysis will be held next year in Nanjing, China. If you have not done already, put this date in your agenda: October 16-20, 2013 (Wednesday to Sunday). We expect again an exciting programme with several workshops and training sessions. This edition of Geomorphometry is kindly sponsored by the Geographical Society of China, National Natural Science Foundation of China, Key Laboratory of Virtual Geographical Environment, Ministry of Education, and Nanjing Normal University. For all other info please refer to www.geomorphometry.org/meetings/nanjing-2013/\n\nColleagues from ESRI are actively producing geomorphometry tools and data sets for public use. This is an example of a multiscale slope map built using the ArcGIS JavaScript API. The ESRI’s World Elevation Services is expected to become fully operational in mid 2012. It will contain image services, data download services, and analysis task services available, as well as sample applications.\n\nGoogle has recently released a Google Elevation service. The Elevation service provides SRTM/bathymetry elevation data for locations on the surface of the earth, including depth locations on the ocean floor (negative values). It can be used to produce elevation paths and get elevations for any point on Earth’s surface (maximum of 2,500 requests per day).\n\nHave you missed the Geomorphometry 2011 conference? No problem. All presentations from Geomorphometry 2011 are available via the ESRI proceedings website. All papers and attached datasets can also be accessed freely from the Geomorphometry homepage.\n\nTanDEM-X is the new generation satellite (owned by the German Aerospace Center) that aims at producing new generation radar-based DEMs with a horizontal detail of 12 meters) and a height accuracy of better than 2 m. The data will likely not be publicly available, but the new global DEM will completely change the world of geomorphometry. http://www.dlr.de/hr/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-2317\n\nA recent geography Master’s thesis by Jason Goetz from the University of Waterloo, Canada utilizes terrain analysis tools implemented in open-source software (SAGA GIS, R) for exploring the regional controls of landslide initiation on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. A nonparametric regression technique, the generalized additive model (GAM), was used to model the relationship of topography, climate, forest harvesting activities and geology to landslide initiation, underlining the importance of the impacts of logging roads. Based on the model predictions, the most susceptible 4% of the study area had 29 times higher density of landslide initiation points than the least susceptible 73% of the study area,\n"

This way we can have a good idea about how many people require some extra time, so that we can contact you to check status of your work (if your submission is not in the EasyChair system). To avoid any uncertainties please submit your article before the indicated deadline.\n\nTo prepare your article, please closely follow the author guidelines.\n\nGEOMORPHOMETRY 2011 WORKSHOPS\n\n\n\nThe Geomorphometry 2011 Workshops have been published on the geomorphometry.org website. Workshops received so far are:\n\n\n  (Reuter Hannes) ArcGIS Geomorphomerty Toolbox\n  (Lucian Dragut &amp;amp; Clemens Eiseink) Discrete analysis of the land-surface: Burning issues and upcoming topics in linking geomorphometry with OBIA\n  (Phillip Verhagen, Lucian Dragut &amp;amp; Frederick W. Limp) Geomorphometric approaches in archeology\n  (Tomislav Hengl &amp;amp; Carlos Grohmann) Automated analysis and visualization of elevation data using open source tools R+OSGeo\n\n\nWorkshops will take the form of either tutorials in a particular method or technique, or provide the opportunity for detailed discussion of upcoming topics. The workshops will be designed based on the sign-ups (after March 2011). A minimum requirement to run a workshop is to collect 10 active participants.

A table of content is available via author’s homepage.\n\n\n\nWorld as a potato? \nAfter just two years in orbit, ESA’s GOCE satellite has gathered enough data to map Earth’s gravity with unrivaled precision. Scientists now have access to the most accurate model of the ‘geoid’ ever produced to further our understanding of how Earth works. With a bit of exaggeration, one would get an idea that our globe is a large potato. The map of gravity undulations can be downloaded from here. See also the complete video about the project.\n"

Geomorphometry is the science of quantitative land-surface analysis and description at diverse spatial scales. It draws upon mathematical, statistical and image-processing techniques and interfaces with many disciplines including hydrology, geology, planetary geomorphology, computational geometry, geomorphology, remote sensing, geographic information science and geography. The conference aims to attract leading researchers in geomorphometry presenting methodological advances in the field and to provide young researchers with an opportunity to present new results.\nRedlands is in San Bernardino County and at the eastern end of the S. Californian metropolis, some 100 km east of Los Angeles. It is between ‘The Badlands’ and the San Bernardino Mountains, beyond which is the Mohave Desert.\n\n\n\nThe Geomorphometry 2011 conference will continue a series initiated by the Terrain Analysis and Digital Terrain Modelling conference hosted by Nanjing Normal University in November 2006 and University of Zurich in 2009.\n\nPossible topics include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n  Extraction of land-surface parameters from DEMs\n  Implications of novel DEM data sources\n  Identification and classification of land-surface objects\n  Uncertainty in geomorphometry\n  Planetary geomorphometry\n  Processing of LiDAR data\n  Semantics of land-surface description\n  3D visualisation in geomorphometry\n  Implications of scale and resolution\n  Flow and hydrological modelling using DEMs\n  Efficient methods for application to large data sets\n  Novel applications of geomorphometry\n\n\n\n\nCONFERENCE PROGRAMME\n\nThe conference programme will be based around a single track of papers, all of which will have been subject to review in the form of extended abstracts by members of the scientific committee. The conference programme is available at:\n\n\n  Conference programme (oral talks; 20 minutes)\n\n\nThe proceedings will be made available both digitally and as printed working materials to attendees at the time of the conference and archived online. A selection of papers will be invited for publication in a special issue of the Transactions in GIS.\n\nWORKSHOPS\n\nGeomorphometry will host two parallel workshops, each with ca. 5-10 attendees after the conference (Saturday day 4):\n\n\n  (Lucian Dragut &amp;amp; Clemens Eiseink) Discrete analysis of the land-surface: Burning issues and upcoming topics in linking geomorphometry with OBIA\n  (Tomislav Hengl &amp;amp; Carlos Grohmann) Automated analysis and visualization of elevation data using open source tools R+OSGeo\n\n\nWorkshops will take the form of either tutorials in a particular method or technique, or provide the opportunity for detailed discussion of upcoming topics. Workshops will be held in Lewis Hall rooms 102, 103, and/or 104. All rooms have ceiling-mounted 1080p-compatible projectors and screens, and white boards (and white board material cabinets covering 2-3 walls). Rooms 103 and 104 also have SmartBoards and auxiliary 42” 1080p monitors. For more info contact: Mark Kumler.\n\nSUBMISSIONS\n\nProspective authors are invited to submit extended abstracts of up to  4 pages (ca 2000 words) by 1st of March 2011.

  "content"  : "FYI: a short report from Geomorphometry 2009 by Bob MacMillan (ISRIC) published in the Pedometron newsletter #28:\n\n“The main purpose of my participation was to keep informed about other efforts, similar to GlobalSoilMap.net, that have a interest in processing digital elevation data and other digital data sets globally or at least for extremely large areas. This conference actually contained a large number of presentations of direct relevance for the GlobalSoilMap.net project. Perhaps first and foremost were the descriptions of efforts being undertaken in Australia (Gallant and Read) and Europe (Köthe and Bock) to process SRTM DEM data at 30 m (Australia) and 90 m (Europe) grid resolution to reduce artefacts and produce a filtered and cleaned DEM that is more suitable for use to produce inputs for the GlobalSoilMap.net project. Both of these presentations highlighted the significant advantages that can be realised by applying a series of filtering and conditioning routines to the original raw SRTM DEM data. It is obvious that similar procedures would prove equally useful if applied to SRTM DEM data sets for other parts of the world under the jurisdiction of other GlobalSoilMap.net nodes. Gallant has offered to help with efforts in other Nodes if asked.\n\nAlso of great interest were several projects that demonstrated that it is indeed possible to process and produce digital output for global scale digital data sets, including global scale SRTM DEM data sets. Reuter and Nelson presented a description of WorldTerrain, a contribution of the Global Geomorphometric Atlas. Peter Guth described processing of global scale SRTM data to identify and classify organized linear landforms (dunes). Peter also provided examples of multiple scale analysis and illustrated what you get to “see” from DEMs of 1 m, 100 m and 2 km grid resolution. Guth intends to publish the many different grids of DEM derivatives he produced for his project and make these processed data available for free and widespread use by others. Marcello Gorini described a physiographic classification of the ocean flood using a multi-resolution geomorphometric approach.\n\nSeveral authors presented methods that may prove of interest to the GlobalSoilMap.net project. Gallant and Hutchinson described a differential equation for computing specific catchment area that could be applied to produce an improved terrain covariate for use in the GlobalSoilMap.net project. Similarly, Peckham, gave a new algorithm for creating DEMs with smooth elevation profiles that could be used to condition rough SRTM or GDEM data sets to smooth out noise and produce more hydrologically plausible surfaces. This algorithm was of particular interest to the GlobalSoilMap.net project because it appeared to be able to introduce hydrologically and geomorphologically relevant detail into 90 m SRTM DEMs of relatively low spatial detail.\n\nRomstad and Etzelmuller described a new approach for segmenting hillslopes into landform elements by applying a watershed algorithm to a surface defined by the total curvature at a point instead of the raw elevation value. The resulting watersheds were bounded by lines of maximum curvature, effectively structuring each hillslope into components partitioned by lines of maximum local curvature. This is harder to explain than to understand when illustrated but it is remarkably simple to implement and may provide a new way of automatically segmenting hillslopes in a simple and efficient fashion.\n\nMetz and others presented an algorithm for fast and efficient processing of massive DEMs to extract drainage networks and flow paths. This is of considerable interest and relevance to the GlobalSoilMap.net project because of the project’s need to process SRTM data globally to compute hydrological flow networks and various indices that are computed based on flow networks (e.g. elevation above channel, distance from divide). This algorithm can process data sets of hundreds of millions of cells (11,424 rows by 13,691 cols) in a few minutes instead of a few days (or not at all for some algorithms that fail on data sets this large).\n\nOverall, this was an excellent conference, dominated by leading edge research in the area of geomorphic processing of digital elevation data that is of direct relevance and interest to the GlobalSoilMap.net project. We have much to learn from these researchers and much to benefit from maintaining contacts and working relationships with them.”\n"

  "content"  : "By: Marcelo Gorini\n\nSitting on a bench at a friend’s house in Brest, France, I look at the windy landscape and think of triangles and kebabs - a strange combination of thoughts, I know, but its origin can be found in the last events of my life, as you will soon understand.\n\nI have spent the last two weeks in my first European travel experience and it seems that I’ve been far from home for a long time. Not because it hasn’t been a good experience or something like that, but simply because so much has happened that time is slowly passing by. I have been to the Swiss Alps driving in its curly roads of perfect tarmac and glorious mountains. Sometimes icy tongues of sliding glaciers would fall free from the top of the mountains; sometimes the mountain would bar its progress letting escape just a thin cascade of transparent green water. I have been to Switzerland’s most prominent mountain – the Matterhorn – also known as Cervin or Cervino…. in any language a queen mountain of great beauty, the mountain that my father has always wanted to climb and that I hope one day I will. I have slept in a peaceful German-speaking hotel before the Furka pass, just to be cursed out by an Italian old man a few kilometers to the east in the other side of the mountains in the following day. I got almost drunk with crazy Italians in Orvieto – a medieval town north of Rome – and the following day, after eating a “prosciutto” pizza in the mountain town of Norchia, I was wetting my feet in the Adriatic Sea, near St. Benedeto. I walked by the ruins of ancient Rome and marveled at its grandeur, but with the feeling that they were like animals in a zoo, with its natural beauty taken away by protecting cages and tourist cameras.\n\nI have done lots of great things in these few days and seen wonderful natural and man-made landscapes, but what really fills my mind (and heart) right now are the very first events, that happened in the fairy-tale city of Zürich. There, little more than a handful of leading researchers in the field of Geomorphometry, together with a few more eager-to-learn Ph.D. students, got together to make wonderful science. I am a Brazilian oceanographer who had the honor to participate in such an event and would like to share with you my happiness for having done so.\n\n\n\nFig: Perfect roads and glorious mountains. What a beautiful country!\n\nThe definition of Geomorphometry is the science of quantitative land-surface analysis (Pike, 1995, 2000a; Rasemann et al., 2004) but I like to think of it as the discipline of Geomorphology after most of its subjectivity is replaced by reproducible mathematical descriptions of the landscape with the help of computer technology. It is an interdisciplinary field of unique beauty, which allows one to look at the three-dimensional landscape and to see it in a multi-dimensional space far richer in information than the eyes alone could ever capture.Both the ability of the human eye to capture form and the dimensionality of datasets and methods received much attention in these three days of conference and scientific talks about geomorphometry, so much that I am unable to address all that has been said. Actually, a long time will be necessary for all the new information that I have listened is processed and organized in my brain in such a way that it can eventually become real knowledge. Even so, I would be glad to paint you a rough picture of what it was, hopefully, without making too many mistakes.\n\nGeomorphometry 2009 began with two workshops of very different flavors. Back to reality – Reconciling geomorphometry and geomorphology in the field was a delightful field trip to a forested area near Zurich called Sihlwald, when people actually measured the landscape and compared the field-derived data to a high-resolution LIDAR dataset for the area. Oliver Korup (WSL, Switzerland) moderated the workshop and led the participants to an in-depth discussion of the pros and cons, as well as the potentials of LIDAR-based geomorphometry. Automated analysis of elevation data in R+SAGA/GRASSwas the other workshop which focused in the use of open source software packages to process elevation data. Unfortunately, the workshops were run in parallel and I could not attend both, so I decided to be more objective and try to learn some scripting since that is what I intend to do most from now on. I had to content myself in appreciating Switzerland’s marvelous landscapes through my untrained eyes.\n\nThis is when I must talk a little bit about triangles, which explain part of the weird title of this text. Actually, it is a happy triangle. Tomislav Hengl (University of Amsterdam) and his colleague Carlos Grohmann (a Brazilian like me, but – poor guy!  from São Paulo) were my teachers in the ways of the happy triangle which consists of a suit of softwares for complete analysis of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), the basis for any geomorphometric analyses.\n\nThe topmost vertex of the triangle is a statistical computing software called R which acts as a core software from which you can control all the others deciding how to distribute the analyses and how to run operations. It also provides a robust way of assessing accuracy and quality of the analyses carried out through statistics. In another vertex of the triangle lies the combination of two leading GIS software available freely in the web: SAGA and GRASS. Both programs have amazing functionalities with respect to DEM pre-processing, morphometric and terrain analyses, hydrology and much more. There was an undeclared context running (not really undeclared) in the background of the workshop between the SAGA man (Tomislav) and the GRASS man (Carlos). The result of this unfair challenge (Brazilians “naturally” tend to overcome Croatians) was a lot of knowledge being passed open-heartedly to the participants with the clear intention of diffusing it so that it can progress. The last vertex of the triangle was Google Earth, a very well-know GIS platform for visualization of spatial data that represents the output of the triangle.\n\nThe students differed in reaction: some followed with great ability the scripts and enjoyed the experience; others were a little frightened by the not-so-user-friendly GRASS and yet others were concerned by R (“R-Inferno” for some). I, myself, tried to disguise my fear of not accompanying the class blaming my 64-bit computer and eventually asking my friend Thomas (great “streams have two sides” guy) for help. But one thought, I believe, populated everybody’s minds while we savored some sausages with beer in our last-day barbecue: “This triangle is indeed a happy one!”\n\n\n\nFig: The Happy Triangle.\n\nThe first day of conference began with Ross Purves (University of Zurich) welcoming us all in his Scottish way (wearing shorts that pleased everybody for the informality) and presenting the first talks. Ralph Straumann was the first to speak and I was really glad to watch him argue that before applying any of the numerous algorithms available for extraction and classification of landforms (or landform elements), one should first strengthen the ontological basis of such approaches and review aspects such as breadths, properties and interrelationships of landforms. The idea that even the concepts of continental landforms are still bound to controversies gives me an ease of mind to address the even less clear landform-related domain knowledge of marine geomorphology.\n\nTomislav then formalized the SAGA/GRASS context by presenting a comparative analysis of both software based on objective and subjective criteria, including user’s satisfaction following questionnaires that we answered just the day before. Despite some clear differences between both softwares, I would say that the actual winner of the context was the scientific community, which has been experiencing a boost over the last few years with respect to the use of high-quality open source GIS, and can count on both SAGA and GRASS for state-of-the-art geomorphometric analyses.\n\nAfter our first coffee break, Ian Evans (University of Durham) kept on introducing the next presenters which showed methodological developments concerning hydrological and viewshed analysis. I could do little more than admire what was being presented, but I could not help noticing the child-like excitement of John  Gallant (CSIRO) presenting his (and Hutchinson’s) differential equation for specific catchment area. It is amazing how these men can dedicate their lives for so long to geomorphometry and still retain so much enthusiasm for it. I just hope it is the same with my not-too-far-in-the-future married life.\n\nAfter lunch, Ian Evans introduced (not really necessary) the first keynote speaker of the conference – Jo Wood (City University London). Well, at this moment, despite the alkaline tide that was forming in everybody’s blood after meal, I can guarantee that no one had their eyes closed. Mine were wide open, just as my mouth was. Jo gifted us with a presentation that I remember more as a science fiction movie full of special effects. Concepts such as information visualization, visual analytics, information and visual scalability, and even human scalability, were introduced in a way that not only provoked us, as Ian Evans said he would, but also immersed us in a kind of flash forward of geomorphometry.\n\nAfter that, still feeling a little dizzy from Wood’s visions, we were presented with some very interesting object-based approaches for the extraction of landform elements. This is a rather recent field of geomorphometry which has been receiving increasing attention as higher resolution datasets become available and individual pixels have diminishing importance when compared to larger segments that can be more easily associated to geomorphologically significant landform elements. Many of us were particularly impressed by the computational simplicity and geomorphological content of Bård Romstad’s (University of Oslo) presentation of his (and Etzelmuller’s) methodology based on watershed segmentation of curvature.\n\nAfter the coffee break, things got really rough for me in this last session of presentations concerning soil mapping. Not only this field of knowledge isn’t really a part of oceanographic studies, but also my apprehension with respect to the first talk of the next morning (MINE!) was getting uncomfortably high. I remember lots of statistics, object-based segmentation and classification (very interesting for my ongoing studies), an extensive revision of soil maps… all that in the middle of a cloud of thoughts such as “These guys know too much what they are talking about; I think I should just get a couple of (dozen) beers and inadvertently get the nearest tram to Brazil”.\n\nWell, I didn’t quite do that, but I did have a couple of beers with my Belgian friend Nicolas who introduced me to my first kebab ever, but not without conveniently forgetting to tell me how hot it was. So, in a tentative way of putting down my fire, I tried to taste the local Swiss delicacies (with questionable success) and then went to the hotel admiring the cool air that came from the lake and resembled the calm before the storm.\n\nWhen I went to the front row of the conference room the next morning, I was welcomed by John Gallant in such an easygoing way that I got relaxed instantaneously. To see all those prominent researchers in front of me with really interested faces waiting for my words made me realize that I was there for some reason: something in my work had captured their attention way before when they accepted my paper to be presented and now I had only to tell them what I knew by heart. And I tried to do that as passionately as I could, valuing the historical effort of those who preceded me for more than half a century in ocean mapping and understanding. Then I showed a simple methodology for the physiographic classification of the ocean floor using geomorphometry. I told them a story I think they liked… and I was happy.\n\nMy presentation was part of the Global-Scale Geomorphometry session and Peter Guth (US Naval Academy) followed showing his famous Global Geomorphometric Atlas and I was honored to open the show for him (you know, like that really obscure band that plays for 30 minutes before the flabbergasting 2-hour show by a mammoth group like the Rolling Stones, U2 or Pink Floyd). His linear sand dune recognition methodology initiated a series of discussions with respect to applications of SRTM data and was closely followed by Hannes Reuter who amused us when he told he was about to begin a geomorphometric atlas when Peter Guth simply did it all by himself before.\n\nAfter the coffee break, Jo Wood was the obvious choice to moderate a session regarding multiscale methods in geomorphometry. I am particularly fond of this subject and it was a real pleasure to see Katherine Arrell (University of Leeds) talking about scaling trends (or scale tendencies) of surface roughness to characterize landscape types. The advantages of wavelet analysis compared to classic Fourier analyses, explained by Michael Kalbermatten (Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) as due to the more localized information-content, also interested me very much in spite of my limited understanding (what a euphemism!) of the mathematical theory involved. Lucian Dragut (University of Salzburg) followed with a thorough assessment of different ways to incorporate scale in geomorphometry. He also made the terrible mistake of giving me his professional card which I will use to disturb him with my endless questions regarding this matter before he finally realizes that and changes all his contact details. After that, my friend Carlos did a great job analyzing different measures of surface roughness of topography. The last comparative graph he showed was particularly elucidative (I wonder how long you took to do that, huh?).\n\nWe then had lunch and, after that, the terrible sin of envy almost disarranged my stomach. We had an industrial keynote by Stephan Landtwing (BSF Swissphoto), a key producer of LIDAR data in Switzerland. The only thing I want to say about that is that in my work I used a dataset with a cell size of 3700 meters while you lucky guys have at your disposal at least 1 meter resolution LIDAR datasets. This means that for every single elevation information I get for the ocean floors, you have 13690000 data points with LIDAR. Enough said about that…\n\nHannes Reuter, of course, presided over the next session regarding data considerations. Trying (unsuccessfully) not to sound too fond of John Gallant’s work, I must say that I was really impressed by his (and his colleagues’, locked in that small room back in Australia) methodology to enhance SRTM data for Australia (which is already much better than in any other place…lucky them!). I could see in this session how you all treat with such detail the quality of the data you use and that is a lesson I will definitely take home for my new investigations of ocean topography.\n\nMy friend Nicolas Sougnez (University of Louvain) began the next session with a geologically intense presentation of channel and slope morphology followed by unique geomorphological applications regarding fitting scoria cones for morphometric analyses and landslide stability models. I must confess that my mind was beginning an auto-fagocitosis process after trying for so long to grasp all that was being presented in those two days of conference plus two days of happy triangle. My blood was getting too thick and I simply needed a beer (or two – or rather, a dozen) to lighten up my mind. Thank the gods it was Conference Dinner time!\n\nI was beginning to feel afraid when after taking a tram up a cliff, and walking for more than ten minutes, I still could not see any sign of beers and someone began talking about the rain forecasted for the night. Was Ross Purves guiding us for a stroll through the park or for a restaurant to get some real food? Thankfully it was the latter and we had a great dinner regaled with beer and wine. There was even a Portuguese waitress who kept filling my glass of beer (no complaints there). When Ian Evans and Tom Hengl called for attention and said, among other beautiful things, what a perfect meeting that was, I knew that it was a rare and special occasion and I felt very lucky to be part of it. My Austrian friend Markus (University of Innsbruck) lit a cigarette and I thought - “Why not?” - And on we went smoking our cigarettes, talking about life and having a really good time among great people.\n\nNow I should begin talking about the last day of conference… but the night would not end. After the rain began, half the people went away and the other half pursued more beers being guided by my Swiss friend Mathias from the WSL Institute (which later acted as my personal photographer – thanks, man!). Well, from now on, time began to accelerate and I began doing this “round-by-round” way of drinking with these Aussie guys (my friend Brendan from the University of Sydney included) who wouldn’t stop drinking. The group divided itself again and, of course, I stayed with the portion that was still chasing more beers….or something else. Well, the night accelerated again and, when I woke up, I was late and all I could think was my Dutch friend Roderik (Delft University of Technology) presenting his Martian morphology classification without me there to watch (he was the second to present that morning). I don’t know if he would really care, but he comes from a Viking lineage, so I really did not want to risk crossing him. I ran to the university and could still watch half of Tomasz Stepinsky’s (Lunar and Planetary Institute) presentation. It was a pity to miss the other half since I like very much these extraterrestrial approaches (specially his papers), but at least I could watch the fancy movie Roderik presented and, as a reward for my effort, he loaded my GRASS with the entire MOLA DEM. I was really thankful and happy about it. I must confess that while Balazs Szekely (Vienna University of Technology) was presenting a very interesting methodology for extraction of Martian talus slopes, I was playing around with 3D visualizations of Mount Olympus and Valles Marineris. Sorry for that!\n\nAfter the coffee break, the most difficult part of the conference with respect to my understanding began, so I will be really brief so as not to insult my colleagues with stupid assertions about their work.They talked about water and then ice. That’s it: I can’t be wrong if I stick to just that, can I?\n\nWell, OK, let’s try to do better than that, especially because my friends Nathalie and Laura would be mad at me if I didn’t. Paolo Tarolli (University of Padova) presented with his strong and pleasant Italian accent (I wonder how mine sounds) a very important analysis of cell size dependence in threshold conditions for the delineation of drainage networks. I believe that is the kind of work that everybody is a little lazy about doing, but which is so essential to proper extraction of landforms. Another thing I remember of Paolo was his comment after a previous presentation that he had found that sometimes a lower resolution is more adequate for some studies than the full resolution of LIDAR data. This was an interesting topic in this conference, but what I would like to say now is something else. I remember thinking that when Paolo talked about that fact, he was clearly expecting that some discussions and brainstorms would follow, which did not. Naturally, there was no time for such things and I am sure he understood that immediately, but that could be a suggestion for new editions of Geomorphometry – more time for discussions. I would really enjoy watching all these researchers in a ferocious discussion about anything – I am sure many ideas would flourish.\n\nMy French friend Nathalie Thommeret (CNRS) followed presenting her (and Bailly’s and Puech’s) algorithm for extraction of thalweg networks and I remember Bob Macmillan (ISRIC) complimenting her work, which, I am sure, was really deserved and made her proud. She was a bit nervous in the preceding moments of the presentation, but I believe she took my advice and had a couple of beers to calm her down, because her presentation was great! More analyses of initiation thresholds with respect to DEM resolution followed with Ashraf Afana’s (Arid Zones Research Station) presentation (this seems to be a really hard issue in hydrology). Then came my pit-removing Italian friend Laura Poggio (The Macaulay Institute Aberdeen) who had only one regret in this conference: meeting me. Since I don’t really understand anything about filling, carving and optimal hybrid algorithms for pit removal I must state a question right now: is it prohibited to drink coffee in the buses in Zurich? Well, I hope it is because she made me throw away all my coffees before taking the buses from our hotel, so if I slept in any of the presentations, it is her fault.\n\nOur post-lunch keynote was a profound talk by David Mark (University at Buffalo). Few talks made me think so much. What he and Mr. Straumann in the beginning of the conference said about ontology made me realize that this must be my next step in the search for a proper methodology to map the ocean floors: I must question very much the ontological nature of oceanic landforms prior to any attempt at extracting them from DEMs. Most of the physiographic knowledge of the ocean floor has been immutable since decades ago and I wonder if questions concerning what entities really exist, or if they can be grouped or if they are related to one another, are really being asked nowadays? The increasing availability of high-resolution datasets makes it irresistible to go deeply into the details of geomorphology, but are we losing the big picture? I feel that I still have much to learn from global scale geomorphometry and I believe now that if I ask the right questions keeping ontology in mind, I will eventually get to smaller-scale studies with a much more thorough understanding of marine landforms (could we say seaforms or oceanforms?).\n\nHydrologic talks continued to hammer my tired mind with another GRASS guy’s work –Markus Metz (German Primate Center). I remember seeing some very good results of his (and Mitasova’s and Harmon’s) new implementation of hydrologic analysis based on a least-cost path algorithm, however, my capacity of comprehension was really diminishing with the looming end of the conference. It is impressive how tiring can it be just to think, even in a comfortable seated position.\n\nThe last session of the conference came with a subject at which we Brazilians are experts: Glaciology! Well, the closest I got to glaciological studies in my life was the first and only time I practiced some snowboarding in Chile. After a very “clever” manoeuvre, I turned sideways in the track and buried the side of the board in the snow. This made me somersault and hammer my face in the ice right before the board came crashing on my skull, making me roll into the powder snow off-piste. That episode gave me seven stitches and all the knowledge I have of glaciology: ice is hard and snow is soft.\n\nAnyway, I watched Andreas Linsbauer’s (University of Zurich) neatly named presentation “The Swiss Alps without Glaciers” thinking of Ian Evans’ comment to me two days before about simulating ice over Rio de Janeiro’s mountains. A beautiful name for this unique paper could be “Rio de Janeiro WITH Glaciers: A GIS-based Modelling Approach for Destruction of My Carnival”. Not a very good thought.\n\nSpeaking of the Devil, Ian Evans followed, teaching us allometric considerations in specific geomorphometry. Allometry was a new and very interesting concept for me, but to listen to Evans pontificate about general and specific geomorphometry, concepts that have always guided me in my studies, was a pleasure on its own (so I had to film it). Regula Frauenfelder (University of Zurich) then had the honor to close the presentations with a very fine and visually appealing presentation regarding morphometric modelling of rockglaciers.\n\nWell, the conference finally came to an end and awards for best paper and best PhD student presentation were given by Ian Evans and Tom Hengl. John Gallant (very deservedly) received the best paper award, which I am sure is not an uncommon situation in his life, and the best student presentation award was given to me. I must say that it was such a pleasant surprise that it took me a while to realize that Tomislav was calling my name. I made a huge effort to be in Zurich for this conference, but that moment alone rewarded me in a complete way and will stimulate my studies for a long time. Sure, the knowledge contained in the book they gave me will teach me for years to come, but what will really keep me going during the hard moments are the autographs in the counter-page. I thank them with all my heart.\n\nTo finish this manuscript, I would like to describe a brief and simple moment regarding a kebab. After the conference was over, me and my friend Nicolas went to have a kebab and beer in celebration of all that had happened. When we were almost finishing, Lucian Dragut appeared and after noticing our presence, came to join us. We had another beer while talking trivialities and a little of geomorphometry and, despite being tired, it was a very relaxing moment. Then someone called him on the phone and he gave some directions to the kebab place so that the other people, who seemed to be drinking somewhere else, could join us. A few moments passed and a very distinguished figure appeared wearing a beige suit and a nice “geographical” tie: it was Ian Evans.\n\nHe did exactly the same thing as Lucian and sat down to have a kebab and a beer and began talking with us. He talked about his late mother, who passed her last years in a care home with local staff, which is increasingly unusual as many care staff speak a different language and have different backgrounds. His mother was happy eating what she had eaten for decades, with staff who understood her.\n\nAfter a few moments of pleasant conversation, I noticed my exhausted Belgian friend and decided to call it a night. I shook their hands and left for my hotel after a goodbye hug from Nicolas.\n\n\n\nFig: The Kebab. (from left to right: Me, Ian Evans and my friend Nicolas).\n\nThis final contact with such leading researchers of this field of knowledge that I have come to love made me realize what had been so special about that conference. During all five days of conference, be it in the presentations or the workshops, in the keynotes, in the beer-filled meetings, during the thankfully long coffee breaks, when I disturbed them for pictures, when I asked personal questions or when I shook their hands….in all of these situations I felt NO ego whatsoever coming out from anybody. Who would have more right to have an over-developed ego than these men that practically created geomorphometry as it is today and will continue to develop it? Who would have more right to be inaccessible for inexperienced students? Yet they were there talking about their family and eating kebabs with almost total strangers. They were incredibly humble super scientists making beautiful science and inspiring many to follow their path.\n\nI am very grateful for having had the chance to know these men and the only thing I hope is that I am up to the task of honoring them with passionate and true geomorphometry. P.S. 1: Please forgive me if I failed to mention someone or to give enough credit for someone’s work. I could never believe I would be able to write a detailed (and ground-truth) report of what has happened, so please take this manuscript, instead, as a crude version of the truth, but one written with the passion of someone who really admires these men and what their work represents. P.S. 2: I bet no one will ever have a kebab again without thinking of triangles, will you? :)\n"

  "content"  : "“Quantitative analysis of DEMs for hydrology and Earth system science“\nHydrology and Earth System Sciences\nAn Interactive Open Access Journal of the European Geosciences Union\nThe guest editors: Ross Purves, Peter Molnar and Stephan Gruber\n\nWe invite submissions to a special issue of Hydrology and Earth System Sciences (HESS) on Geomorphometry and Hydrology to coincide with the conference Geomorphometry 2009, held in Zurich in September 2009. Papers are invited from participants at the conference, but also those in the broader academic community active in this field.\n\nThe aim of the special issue is to showcase papers illustrating how geomorphometry can be used in hydrology and the potential for future developments in hydrology and earth systems sciences resulting from geomorphometry. The linkage between geomorphometry, the science of quantitative land surface analysis, and hydrology is intimate, since geomorphometry aims to describe land surfaces that are shaped by, and shape, hydrological processes on the earth’s surface. Topics of interest to the special issue might include, but are not restricted to:\n\n\n  Methods for classifying objects within catchment areas (that is to say attaching semantics to catchments to allow their description and comparison).\n  Investigations of the potential of new data sources, such as LIDAR, for hydrological parameters, and the development of new parameters to describe catchments at such resolutions.\n  Methods to link processes across scales through, for instance, comparisons of catchment properties across scales and comments on their robustness with respect to uncertainty.\n  Scalable methods for calculation of hydrological parameters at continental and global scales.\n  Linking topographic parameters at a variety of scales to hydrological processes.\n  New advances in methods for pre-processing, analysis and visualization of elevation models for hydrological and earth system sciences applications.\n\n\nWhen preparing papers for the special issue, it is important that authors make clear the relevance of the work to hydrology and earth systems sciences in the sense of the general aims of HESS.\n\nSubmissions must be new, unpublished work which is has neither been previously published, nor is under consideration for publication elsewhere except in the form of an abstract or proceedings type publication.\n\nSubmissions will be accepted for review from the 1st of September through HESS’s online submission system. Please carefully review all of the information provided by HESS in preparing your submission. Note that HESS is an open-access journal with associated page charges.\n\nThe final special issue can be accessed here: https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/special_issue114.html\n"

  "content"  : "Workshop moderator: Oliver Korup\n\nLocation: Sihlwald area, SW of Lake Zurich\n\nMeeting point: Zurich Central Railway Station (“Zürich HB”) @ “Group Meeting Point” (indicated by a large red cube!). Meeting time is 9 AM. Please try to be punctual so that we can catch the 9.18 service to Sihlwald station (train no. S4). There is no need for registered participants to purchase a ticket, which is included in the conference fees.\n\nDaily programme:\n\n\n  Full-day field-based workshop: Sihlwald area 30 min. from Zurich on train (participants bring their own field lunch; there are several nice BBQ spots, so think of packing the odd sizzler; also make sure to bring plenty of fluids as late summer can still be very warm)\n  Brief overview of the area: Quaternary geomorphology, historic land use, recent conservation strategies\n  Review of key morphometric parameters and scale/resolution effects\n  Presentation of high-resolution LIDAR data for the area\n  Group-based exercises to determine locally morphometric parameters\n  Comparison of field- and LIDAR-derived parameters\n  Final group discussion on the advantages, potentials, and limits of LIDAR-based geomorphometry\n\n\n\n\nNECESSARY EQUIPMENT: outdoor wear (incl. sturdy footwear and raingear)\n\nINTENDED AIMS AND SCOPE: • To test the applicability and reliability of LIDAR and other DEM-derived attributes by comparison with field-derived data; • To raise awareness among LIDAR users of the potential pitfalls and limitations that come with enhanced resolution DEMs; • To re-appreciate the meaning of terrain parameters and their applicability in geomorphic research.\n\nThis field trip is also intended as an icebreaker reception, so socialising is more than welcome. We would like to use this opportunity to bring “geomorphometrists” together to discuss in an informal manner pending issues of high-resolution DEMs and DTMs in an actual landscape rather than at the desktop. The Sihlwald is a pleasant and mainly forested area near Zurich that caters for nearly all levels of fitness and recreational demands. It also hosts a number of challenges for digital terrain analyses, which we will explore during some leisurely walks and group discussions. The underlying idea is not to simply reiterate known problems of LiDAR data, but to consider ways of improving their use in geomorphometry and related disciplines.\n\n\n\nOverview map of the area. The blue area is Lake Zurich.\n"

  "content"  : "Here are the results of the e-democracy and society meeting discussion. We received 29 votes from 64 registered members (44%). Considering future organization of the society 45% of members confirmed that they prefer to keep the society of small size, while 45% of members believe that we should try to get anybody working with DEMs involved with this society.\n\nConsidering the name of the society, 89% of members find the current name “geomorphometry” more appropriate than “terrain analysis” (11%). One member proposed that the official name should be “Geomorphometry: the science of digital terrain analysis”, which seem to be the best compromise between the two alternatives. A large majority of members (90%) believes that the focus of geomorphometry should be on both technology and methods.\n\nConsidering the organization of future meetings, majority of members (48%) believes that the registration costs of the conference should not exceed 100 USD per day, however, 37% of members also do not mind the costs of registration if the programme is good. Most of people nominated Ian Evans (38%) and John Gallant (11%) for the chair, and Tomislav Hengl (52%) and Ross Purves (11%) for the vice-chairs. Both of the first nominated candidates have accepted this nomination and will represent the society until the next conference (2011). The chair and vice-chair will take further steps to organize the next meetings, regularly send information and news to all registered members (geomorphometry mailing list), and facilitate various workshops and international collaboration. They will also ensure that the coming meetings follow some quality requirements, e.g. that they focus on the topics of interest to geomorphometry society, that the first call is send on time, that enough information is provided for international visitors etc.\n\nConsidering the location of the next conference, 41% of members would like that the next geomorphometry conference stays in Europe, 31% of members would like to leave the decision to the scientific committee, 17% voted for North America. We discussed the dangers of having two conferences in a line on the same continent, and concluded that possibly the best decision will be to organize the next conference in USA, considering that the TADTM conference in 2006 was in China, 2009 was in Europe, so that this seems to be the most logical solution.\n\nIn the final block of the society meeting, we have carefully discussed advantages and disadvantages of having a more formally organized society and possible alternatives: e.g. optional merging with some other (bigger) research group such as International Association of Geomorphologists, GIS societies, ISPRS and similar. We concluded that (1) geomorphometry is a distinct field that certainly has an audience and future (especially considering the recent development of LiDAR technology, new geo-visualization tools and new fields of application); (2) place of the next meeting and similar organizational issues should be decided upon during the running conference to ensure sustainability; (3) geomorphometry should try to connect all people involved with production and processing of DEMs and surface models.\n\ne_democracy_2009.xls\n\n"

R is the open-source version of the S language for statistical computing; SAGA (System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses) and GRASS (Geographic Resources Analysis Support System) are the two most used open-source desktop GIS for automated analysis of elevation data. A combination of R+SAGA/GRASS provides a full integration of statistics and geomorphometry. The topics in this workshop will range from selection of grid cell size, choice of algorithms for DEM generation and filtering, to geostatistical simulations and error propagation. The workshop moderators will demonstrate that R+SAGA/GRASS is capable of handling such demanding tasks as DEM generation from auxiliary maps, automated classification of landforms, and sub-grid parameterization of surface models.\n\nThe course will focus on understanding R and SAGA/GRASS syntax and building scripts that can be used to automate DEM-data processing. Each participant should come with a laptop PC and install all software needed prior to the workshop. Registered participants will receive an USB stick with all data sets and overheads at the beginning of the course.\nParticipants will follow a case study that focuses on generation of DEMs, extraction of DEM parameters and landform classes, and implementation of error propagation in geomorphometry.\n\n\n\nSOFTWARE INSTALLATION:\n\nPlease make sure you come to this workshop with software already installed and running. You need to install at least (please respect the chronological order):\n\n\n  R (2.9)\n    \n      after the installation open R and install necessary packages (install.views(“Spatial”))\n      install separately packages “spgrass6” and “RSAGA”\n    \n  \n  Tinn-R\n  GRASS GIS (6.4)\n  SAGA GIS (2.0.3)\n    \n      the latest version of SAGA will be distributed at the beginning of the workshop!\n    \n  \n\n\nFor simplicity, try to come with a Windows OS, possibly with a dual boot (Linux or Mac OS as the 2nd OS).\nHere are some examples of code that you could test under your machine.\n"

  "content"  : "\n\nOn behalf of the organisers we would like to extend a warm welcome to all participants of Geomorphometry 2009 in Zurich. The Geomorphometry 2009 conference continues a series initiated by the Terrain Analysis and Digital Terrain Modelling conference hosted by Nanjing Normal University in November 2006.\n\nGeomorphometry 2009 brings together researchers to present and discuss developments in the field of quantitative modelling and analysis of elevation data. Geomorphometry is the science of quantitative land-surface analysis and description at diverse spatial scales. It draws upon mathematical, statistical and image-processing techniques and interfaces with many disciplines including hydrology, geology, computational geometry, geomorphology, remote sensing, geographic information science and geography.\n\nFor the conference, a total of 53 extended abstracts, with authors from 21 countries were submitted for review by the programme committee. Of these, a total of 37 were accepted for presentation at the conference. We believe that the conference programme offers a rich and varied insight into the key themes in geomorphometry today, with a mix of leading researchers in the field presenting methodological advances and young researchers presenting high quality reviewed work to an international audience.\n\nThe conference also hosts three keynote speakers. We are delighted that Professor David Mark, SUNY Distinguished Professor in the Department of Geography at the State University of New York at Buffalo and Dr Jo Wood, Reader in GIScience at the Department for Information Science at City University, London will both give presentations on how they have seen development progressing in Geomorphometry during their extensive experience of the field. Furthermore, Stephan Landtwing of BSF Swissphoto, a key producer of LIDAR and other remotely sensed data in Switzerland, will give an industrial keynote – an excellent opportunity for the conference attendees to interface with data producers and better understand issues related to key data sources in geomorphometry.\n\nThe conference also hosted two workshops with very different themes, entitled Automated analysis of elevation data in R+ILWIS/SAGA and Back to reality – Reconciling geomorphometry and geomorphology in the field respectively, providing attendees with the opportunity to get their hands dirty figuratively at the computer screen, and literally in the field!\n\nFinally, we would like to thank all of those who make events such as this a success. Our programme committee, who on time and carefully reviewed a large number of papers, our keynote speakers, the workshop organisers, and all those who helped in the local organisation, especially Dagmar Brandova who dealt with registration, as well as the University of Zurich for providing the conference facilities. Finally, and most importantly, we would like to thank the conference participants – without your work and participation there would be no conference. We hope your stay in Zurich will be an enjoyable and stimulating one.\n\nRoss Purves, Stephan Gruber, Tomislav Hengl and Ralph Straumann August 15th, 2009\n\nAttachment:\nforeword\n"

  "content"  : "We propose a structured, open discussion platform about topics related to the field of Geomorphometry. These Geomorphometry Coffee Talks (GCTs) will give the opportunity to discuss, exchange, initiate, train, present, outline topics, research agendas, papers, questions in an informal way between our main biannual conferences.\n\nTopics to be covered would come for example from the theoretical side, software applications, DEM creation technologies, and experiments up to practical applications in production environments. The speakers will fill these spaces and we count on the Geomorphometry society to bring up topics.\n\nThis platform would be as open as possible to engage with each other and reach out to everyone – not only the research community. Anyone with an interest in Geomorphometry from wherever should be able to attend- there is no subscription policy in place – if you can attend and can make it - you are more than welcome.\n\nEach coffee talk will be featuring an initial 15-20 minute discussion in a Zoom meeting, followed by an open exchange/discussion. The session will conclude at 60 minutes with a short wrap-up of the session by the session moderator. Links to the recorded sessions (if permitted by presenters) will be available at the ISG Website. The ISG Board will draw up a list of topics for a series for a year. Announcements of session topics will be at the website and the social media accounts of the ISG.\n\nProposals for topics can be sent anytime to the Email geomorphometry.org@gmail.com to be included in the schedule. The date is the first Wednesday of every second month at 15:00 UTC to allow worldwide participation.\n\n \n\nSchedule\n\n\n  \n    \n      2023-06-07\n      Dr. Sebastiano Trevisani - Università Iuav di Venezia, Italy  A simplified geostatistical approach for digging into the complexity of surface roughness analysis: need for standardization?
