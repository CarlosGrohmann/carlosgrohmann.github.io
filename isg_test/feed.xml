<p>Digital Terrain Model or Digital Land Surface Model is a digital raster map representing elevations of terrain / bare surface. NASA’s SRTM DEM used to be one of the most famous environmental layers in early 2000’s. In recent years a number of global public topography datasets at high spatial resolutions (30 m) have been released, from which Copernicus GLO-30 and ALOS AW3D30 are the two that can be considered new-generation elevation models. Too many versions of (basically the same) environmental data layer and too many landing pages can often confuse users and decrease the overall usability of such data. To simplify access and usability of such data we are building global Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs that are based on ensembling of multiple data sources, including national/regional datasets. Here is how you can access this data and contribute to the project.</p>

<h1 id="rationale-for-a-new-global-ensemble-dtm">Rationale for a new global Ensemble DTM</h1>

<p>In recent years a number of global public topography datasets at high spatial resolutions (30 m) have been released including <a href="https://spacedata.copernicus.eu/collections/copernicus-digital-elevation-model">GLO-30</a> and <a href="https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/index_e.htm">ALOS AW3D</a>, and that is on top of the existing <a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/competitive-programs/measures/nasadem">NASADEM</a>, <a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/news/new-aster-gdem">ASTER DEM</a>, <a href="http://hydro.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yamadai/MERIT_DEM/">MERIT DEM</a> and similar. For a complete inventory of global datasets best refer to the <a href="https://portal.opentopography.org/dataCatalog?loc=Global"><strong>OpenTopography</strong> data catalog</a>. Too many versions of (basically the same) environmental data layer and too many landing pages can often confuse users and decrease the overall usability of such data. In addition, most DEMs produced from remote sensing observations are only surface models requiring removal of canopy and similar objects. On the other hand, users typically require a single (most current, most accurate, most complete) terrain model that can then be used to produce all <a href="https://geomorphometry.org/">morphometric and hydrographic terrain variables</a> across borders (see e.g. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201840">Amatulli et al., 2018</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-4525-2022">Amatulli et al., 2022</a>). Previously, the most global consistent Digital model of Terrain (bare-earth or land surface) was the <a href="http://hydro.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yamadai/MERIT_DEM/"><strong>MERIT DEM</strong></a>, available at 100 m resolution (<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL072874">Yamazaki et al., 2017</a>). <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tgis.12825">Guth and Geoffroy (2021)</a> compared multiple global DEMs for the world vs LiDAR points from ICESat and concluded that GLO-30 is most likely the most accurate DEM to date, but again it is a surface model and canopy needs to be removed before it can be used as a DTM.</p>

<p>Recently, a team at University of Bristol produced <a href="https://www.fathom.global/product/fabdem/"><strong>FABDEM</strong></a> (Forest And Buildings removed Copernicus DEM), basically the GLO-30 with buildings and forests removed by machine-learning. The correction algorithm was trained from a unique set of reference elevation from 12 countries, covering a wide range of climate zones and urban extents. Separate random forest models were implemented to estimate canopy height in forests and building height in urban areas and then GLO-30 subtracted height difference to produce FABDEM. This data set is described in detail in <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac4d4f">Hawker et al., (2022</a>) and is available under CC-NC-SA license. An independent accuracy assessment of FABDEM is available in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s40808-022-01648-4">Dandabathula et al. (2022)</a>.</p>

<p>Likewise, our results for the <a href="https://stac.ecodatacube.eu/dtm_elevation/collection.json">Continental Europe</a> have shown that machine learning can be used to remove canopy and buildings, although some post-processing is still needed to create hydrologically correct DTMs (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4724549">Hengl et. al., 2020</a>). Furthermore, number of national DTMs are now also available for large areas, such as <a href="https://ecat.ga.gov.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/89644">Australia DTM</a>, and <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/3d-elevation-program/about-3dep-products-services">USA DTM</a>. Overall, there is a need for an Ensemble DTM that can incorporate multiple valuable datasets and post-processing done by different groups (e.g. MERITDEM).</p>

<p>To help reduce the complexity of global elevation datasets and make the data more usable, we have started working on a multipurpose Ensemble DTM for the world. The methods and how to access data (available under CC-BY license as <strong>ARCO</strong> — <a href="https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/present-and-future-of-data-cubes-an-european-eo-perspective-735d3f16f7c9">Analysis-Ready Cloud Optimized</a> global mosaic) are outlined below.</p>

<h1 id="building-the-30m-ensemble-terrain-model-edtm30">Building the 30m Ensemble Terrain Model (EDTM30)</h1>

<p>Although terrain can be estimated using <a href="https://icesat.gsfc.nasa.gov/">ICESat</a> / <a href="https://daac.ornl.gov/daacdata/gedi/">GEDI</a> points as reference training data, we test here using a more simple procedure for building a DTM that allows for faster updates and easy additions of new data: using lower 10% probability quantile. Advantage of having an inexpensive setup to update Ensemble DTM (EDTM30) is that we could possibly run nightly updates i.e. as soon as countries / regions submit locally produced terrain models.</p>

<p>Why 10% lower quantile? We basically assume that terrain heights are at the lower part of the distribution, so we simply derive lower 10% quantile from multisource data as shown below. We assume that, because canopy is difficult to remove and still remains even in MERITDEM and FABDEM (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s40808-022-01648-4">Dandabathula et al., 2022</a>), deriving 10% lower quantile can further help filter out potential canopy remains.</p>

<p>This is of course a simplification and an arbitrary chosen number. Although computationally efficient, there is no guarantee that using lower 10% quantile will remove all canopy problems (e.g. all forests) hence it is important to first remove any pixels that significantly oscillate from MERITDEM. In addition, we here also assume that both AW3D and GLO-30 are the same quality, which might not be true for different parts of the world.</p>

<p><img src="images/1*FDVBXIErsTVfrwlz6eLlkw.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>A simple procedure used to derive an Ensemble estimate of the terrain elevation.</p>

<p>We run processing, described in the flow chart above, tile by tile (1000 x 1000 pixels). In summary <a href="https://gitlab.opengeohub.org/yu-feng.ho/faen-artifact/-/blob/main/ensemble_dtm.ipynb">the process</a> works as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>We first derive standard deviation (s.d.) using the list of DEMs (new map).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For GLO-30, ALOS, we remove all pixels where s.d. values are &gt;6 m (60 dm) i.e. [sd(GLO, ALOS, MERIT, NDTM) &gt; 6 m] AND/OR where canopy height is &gt;2m; for those pixels we assign a NA value i.e. we assume these are DSM or erratic values. Note: for <a href="https://glad.umd.edu/dataset/gedi/">Canopy height</a> a global 30 m layers is provided by UMD GLAD (Potapov et al., 2021).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We next derive a lower 10% quantile from the 5 values (GLO, ALOS, MERIT, NDTM). This is then the EDTM i.e. the most probable bare-earth elevation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also derive standard deviation using the 5 values; which can be used as the uncertainty map. If there is only one value of DEM in the list, we assign the value -1.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The process of deriving the best estimate of DTM is fully documented and automated in this <a href="https://github.com/openlandmap/spatial-layers/blob/main/EDTM/ensemble_dtm.ipynb"><strong>Python script</strong></a>. At the moment it can be used to generate an ensemble DTM within 5 hrs running on a fully parallelized HPC center with cca 1050 threads. Final mosaic of the world is a massive 200GB dataset and still takes significant time to compile a COG:</p>

<p>Dimensions and technical properties of the global mosaic at 30 m spatial resolution.</p>

<p>A demonstration of the maps used and the results obtained (EDTM) is shown below:</p>

<p><img src="images/1*j0sWhwNEiN2Us1jJBbFZvw.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Three original input DEMs. GLO-30 and AW3D30 can be considered to be Digital Surface Models, hence canopy and buildings would need to be removed before it can be used.</p>

<p>In the last stage we compile all output layers as Analysis-Ready-Cloud-Optimized (ARCO) GeoTiff. This gives on the two final layers (1) EDTM in metre (m), and (2) standard deviation showing biggest discrepancies between AW3D, GLO-30, MERITDEM, and national DTMs. The two output COGs are shown below.</p>

<p>Standard deviation of Ensemble DTM in 30 m. This only shows how much the elevation differs from the multisource input data. Note that the highest errors can be noticed in areas with high complex relief i.e. Alps, Himalayas, but also in areas covered with dense vegetation (tropical forests).</p>

The conference only featured oral sessions, with 44 contributions. Three invited keynote talks, by Michael Hutchinson (Australian National University College of Science), Igor Florinsky (Russian Academy of Sciences) and Marco Cavalli (CNR IRPI, Padua) enriched the content of the conference. <a href="http://geomorphometry2021.org/index.php/scientific-program">Contributions</a> were spread over three days, grouped by topic: “use of digital elevation, terrain and surface models” on day 1, “dynamics of earth surface: automated surface analysis and modelization” on day 2, and “modeling geomorphological processes” on day 3.</p>

<p>All of the sessions demonstrated that quantitative analysis of the Earth’s surface is closely related to the scale at which the surface itself is described/represented. Research on a global scale (<em>e.g.</em> aimed at the definition of accurate hydrographic networks) was counterbalanced by studies that focused on centimetric portions of Earth’s surface (<em>e.g.</em> small plates where accretion of tufa/travertine is studied). A related relevant topic was the comparison of lidar data with global (or quasi-global) DEMs and among different global DEMs, using different methods in many study areas. Explicit comparisons highlighted that, in selected areas representative of most existing settings, Copernicus DEM is the best performing; other comparisons in different areas and methods favored MERIT DEM. In all cases, lidar data represents the benchmark. Despite that, a discussion highlighted that peculiar applications may not be so sensitive to details represented in elevation data from lidar and/or SfM measurements to justify the much higher cost. There also have been an explicit proposal to merge global and local elevation data, already existing and available online for Europe.</p>

<p>This also lead to a discussion about the characteristic scale of terrain analysis, and a few presentations described multi-scale approaches as mature tools for a variety of application. Mainly, they described multi-scale methods for estimation of terrain roughness, curvatures, and landform mapping. The relationship between multi-scale approaches and characteristic scale may lead to need of optimization of numerical parameters for terrain analysis and classification.</p>

<p>A few presentations focused on the geomorphological and physical meaning of maps derived from digital terrain models (such as curvatures) or on the definition of new functions aimed at representing the topology of surface water flow directions or the selection of features (derived from DEM) which are relevant in supervised classification applications.</p>

<p>Applications of geomorphometry concepts and algorithms to other disciplines/topics have been numerous and included tectonics, soil erosion, landslide susceptibility, thermokarst phenomena, river forms, coastal habitat and coastal dunes, crevasses in polar ice, inundated areas, glacial cirques and volcanic eruptions.</p>

<p>One addition to the topics of this year’s edition of the conference was specifically commercial and industrial application. The scientific program actually included a few contributions explicitly reporting about industrial processes (microscopic analysis of silicon wafer “topography”) and commercial applications (deposition and analysis of submarine cables, rockfall susceptibility along the Italian national railway). Other contributions, even if not specifically commercial, highlighted the use of algorithms borrowed from computer graphics for terrain segmentation, and adaptation of general purpose software for marine geomorphometry. Moreover, commercial and industrial applications were one of the key topics – along with the role of local/global elevation data – for a proposed session at the upcoming European Geoscience Union General Assembly, prepared by a few of the participants of Geomorphometry 2021.</p>

<p>Contributions presented at the conference are available as peer-reviewed short papers from the <a href="https://doi.org/10.30437/geomorphometry2020">book of Proceedings</a> of the 2020 submissions (CNR Edizioni, Rome), or on <a href="https://zenodo.org/communities/geomorphometry/?page=1&amp;size=20">Zenodo</a>, for new submissions. Most of the presentations are also available as PDF and/or video recording at the <a href="http://geomorphometry2021.org/index.php/scientific-program">conference website</a>; a few of the contributions also have a link to published papers, either on the special issue “Advances in geomorphometry” in the journal <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/14679671">Transaction in GIS</a>.</p>

<p>The paper is the first major contribution of the DEMIX project (<a href="https://youtu.be/veZA4O1rU28">DEM Intercomparison EXercise</a>). The idea is to “consolidate terminology and definitions of key concepts to facilitate a common understanding among the growing community of DEM users,<br />
who do not necessarily share the same background”.</p>

This is basically an Ensemble Machine Learning approach where GEDI level 2B points (Level 2A; “elev_lowestmode”) and ICESat-2 (ATL08; “h_te_mean”) were used to train a multisource model to predict “most probable height of terrain” including the prediction errors per pixel.</p>

<p>So which of the four big global DEM’s is the best match with terrain heights? Our results indicate that it is the <a href="http://hydro.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yamadai/MERIT_DEM/">MERITv1.0.1</a> (originally available at 90-m, but was downscaled here to 30-m using cubic splines) followed by the AW3Dv2012 and GLO-30. This confirms that Yamazaki et al. (2017) have done an excellent work in filtering out canopy and artifacts in the original SRTM/AWD30 data.</p>
