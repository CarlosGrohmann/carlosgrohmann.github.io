The [Brazilian Journal of Geology](www.scielo.br/bjgeo/) is published by the Brazilian Geological Society since 1971 (with a previous title of *Revista Brasileira de Geociencias*) and has been re-structured in 2013 aiming to be the leading journal for Geosciences in Latin America. The journal is indexed by Web of Science, Scopus, GeoRef and is hosted by [SciELO](www.scielo.br/), the largest electronic library of open-access scientific journals.  

In this page I'll post some useful tips and resources for authors interested in submitting their articles to BJGEO.

#### FAQ about publishing:

**Are there any charges for publishing (APCs, color figures...)?**  
No. We don't charge anything for publishing your paper. There are no Article Processing Charges (APCs) or costs for color figures. The journal in online-only so we don't have costs for printing.

All the costs of the BJGEO are covered by the Brazilian Geological Society (through a sponsorship from Petrobras) and by Scientific Publishing Grants from CNPq and CAPES (Federal agencies for Science and Higher Level Education). We are continuously looking for funding opportunities to keep the BJGEO free and open for everyone.

**Where is the submission link?**   
Right [here](https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/bjgeo-scielo). The submission system we use is ScholarOne.

**I've never submitted a paper before. How does it work?** 
Here you will fin a simple guide about the whole process of publishing your article, from the submission to the final celebration (in Portuguese):

- *Da submissão à comemoração, ou como funciona o processo de avaliação de um artigo científico, e qual sua parte nisso* - [https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7701479.v1](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7701479.v1)   

<br>
**How long does it take from submission to first response?** 
This is a common question, and we try to give an answer to the author within 2 months since submission, but maybe the best answer is: it depends. Depends on what? A lot, actually. 

First you submit you paper, then it goes to the Editor-in-Chief (EIC), who will screen it to see if it's a good fit for the journal, if it's an interesting topic, etc. If the paper is considered within our standards, it will be assigned to an Associate Editor (AE). The AE usually handles papers related to his/hers area of specialty (tectonics, petrology, etc) and will invite two or three reviewers to, well, review the paper. Each reviewer has 30 days to return the evaluation and from those recommendations, the AE can make an initial decision (reject/revise). 

If the paper needs revisions, it might take weeks or months until it is ready for a second round of reviews. After the revised version is submitted, the AE can make its own assessment (if it was just minor revisions) or will send it to the reviewers again (if it needed major revisions). 

Of course, all of this can be delayed. Inviting reviewers is not easy, as we all receive lots of requests and it's quite common for someone to be unavailable due to an overload of work. And we're all geoscientists, so we have field trips as well. And we have our professional duties like teaching (for those in academia) and "real work" (for those in the industry). And we have family and friends...

In the end, if the paper is well-written, if the reviewers accept the invitation, if they return their scores in time, if the recommendation is of 'minor review' and if the authors send the revised version quickly, it can be accepted within 4-6 months since the initial submission. 

Since 2019 we adopted a 'continuous flow' of publication. This means that once a paper is accepted, it goes to production (typesetting) and its uploaded to the journal with a final DOI and page numbering (in about 2 weeks).
